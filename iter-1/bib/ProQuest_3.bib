abstract={Online magnetic resonance (MR)‐guided radiotherapy is expected to benefit brain stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) due to superior soft tissue contrast and capability of daily adaptive planning. The purpose of this study was to investigate daily adaptive plan quality with setup variations and to perform an end‐to‐end test for brain SRS with multiple metastases treated with a 1.5‐Tesla MR‐Linac (MRL). The RTsafe PseudoPatient Prime brain phantom was used with a delineation insert that includes two predefined structures mimicking gadolinium contrast‐enhanced brain lesions. Daily adaptive plans were generated using six preset and six random setup variations. Two adaptive plans per daily MR image were generated using the adapt‐to‐position (ATP) and adapt‐to‐shape (ATS) workflows. An adaptive patient plan was generated on a diagnostic MR image with simulated translational and rotational daily setup variation and was compared with the reference plan. All adaptive plans were compared with the reference plan using the target coverage, Paddick conformity index, gradient index (GI), Brain V12 or V20, optimization time and total monitor units. Target doses were measured as an end‐to‐end test with two ionization chambers inserted into the phantom. With preset translational variations, V12 from the ATS plan was 17% lower than that of the ATP plan. With a larger daily setup variation, GI and V12 of the ATS plan were 10% and 16% lower than those of the ATP plan, respectively. Compared to the ATP plans, the plan quality index of the ATS plans was more consistent with the reference plan, and within 5% in both phantom and patient plans. The differences between the measured and planned target doses were within 1% for both treatment workflows. Treating brain SRS using an MRL is feasible and could achieve satisfactory dosimetric goals. Setup uncertainties could be accounted for using online plan adaptation. The ATS workflow achieved better dosimetric results than the ATP workflow at the cost of longer optimization time.},

abstract={Brain tumors are abnormal cell growth in the brain tissues that can be cancerous or not. In any case, they could be a very aggressive disease that should be detected as early as possible. Usually, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the main tool commonly adopted by neurologists and radiologists to identify and classify any possible anomalies present in the brain anatomy. In the present work, an automatic unsupervised method called Z2-γ, based on the use of adaptive finite-elements and suitable pre-processing and post-processing techniques, is introduced. The adaptive process, driven by a Zienkiewicz-Zhu type error estimator (Z2), is carried out on isotropic triangulations, while the given input images are pre-processed via nonlinear transformations (γ corrections) to enhance the ability of the error estimator to detect any relevant anomaly. The proposed methodology is able to automatically classify whether a given MR image represents a healthy or a diseased brain and, in this latter case, is able to locate the tumor area, which can be easily delineated by removing any redundancy with post-processing techniques based on morphological transformations. The method is tested on a freely available dataset achieving 0.846 of accuracy and F1 score equal to 0.88.},

abstract={Background Foot Function Index (FFI) is a valid and reliable outcome measure, which is widely used to measure the foot and ankle functional level and disorders. Until now, no validated Arabic version of the FFI is available. This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this project was to translate and adapt the FFI into Arabic and to evaluate its psychometric properties of validity and reliability. Methods The study consisted of two phases. The first phase was the translation and cultural adaptation of the FFI to Arabic. The next phase involved, testing the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the FFI on a sample of 50 consecutive participants which included internal consistency, test–retest reliability, floor and ceiling effects and construct validity. Results The mean age of the study participants was 38 ± 12.94 years. Both the genders were evenly enrolled with 50% of the participants as male and 50% as female. Majority of them complained of plantar fasciopathy (32%) followed by pes planus (22%) and ankle sprain (18%). The scores of FFI-Ar were normally distributed, confirmed by a significant Shapiro–Wilk test. The mean value of FFI-Ar total score was 47.73 ± 19.85. There were no floor or ceiling effects seen in any of the subscales and total score. The internal consistency was good with the Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.882, 0.936 and 0.850 for the pain, disability and activity limitation subscales, respectively. The reproducibility of the FFI-Ar was analysed by intra-class correlation coefficient which revealed good to excellent test–retest reliability. A significant correlation was found between FFI-Ar and SF-36 and numeric rating scale (NRS) confirming its construct validity. Conclusion The FFI-Arabic version showed good validity and reliability in patients with foot and ankle problems. This tool can be used in usual practice and research for analysing foot and ankle disorders in Arabic-speaking people.},

abstract={PurposeLocalized prostate cancer (PCa) in patients is characterized by a dominant focus in the gland (dominant intraprostatic lesion, DIL). Accurate DIL identification may enable more accurate diagnosis and therapy through more precise targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy and focal ablative therapies. The goal of this study is to validate the performance of 18F]DCFPyL PET and CT perfusion (CTP) for detecting and localizing DIL against digital histopathological images.MethodsMulti-modality image sets: in vivo T2-weighted (T2w)-MRI, 22-min dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET/CT, CTP, and 2-h post-injection PET/MR were acquired in patients prior to radical prostatectomy. The explanted gland with implanted fiducial markers was imaged with T2w-MRI. All images were co-registered to the pathologist-annotated digital images of whole-mount mid-gland histology sections using fiducial markers and anatomical landmarks. Regions of interest encompassing DIL and non-DIL tissue were drawn on the digital histopathological images and superimposed on PET and CTP parametric maps. Logistic regression with backward elimination of parameters was used to select the most sensitive parameter set to distinguish DIL from non-DIL voxels. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was performed to determine diagnostic performance.Results18F]DCFPyL PET and CTP parametric maps of 15 patients were analyzed. SUVLate and a model combining Ki and k4 of 18F]DCFPyL achieved the most accurate performance distinguishing DIL from non-DIL voxels. Both detection models achieved an AUC of 0.90 and an error rate of < 10%. Compared to digital histopathology, the detected DILs had a mean dice similarity coefficient of 0.8 for the Ki and k4 model and 0.7 for SUVLate.ConclusionsWe have validated using co-registered digital histopathological images that parameters from kinetic analysis of 22-min dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET can accurately localize DILs in PCa for targeting of biopsy, radiotherapy, and focal ablative therapies. Short-duration dynamic 18F]DCFPyL PET was not inferior to SUVLate in this diagnostic task.Clinical trial registration number: NCT04009174 (ClinicalTrials.gov).},

abstract={Featured ApplicationAircraft Shock Absorber with Controllable Damping Force.AbstractThis work presents a novel design model of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based shock absorber (MR shock absorber in short) that can be applied to an aircraft landing gear system. When an external force acts on an MR shock absorber, pressure loss occurs at the flow path while resisting the fluid flow. During the flow motion, two pressure losses occur: the major loss, which is proportional to the flow rate, and the minor loss, which is proportional to the square of the flow rate. In general, when an MR shock absorber is designed for low stroke velocity systems such as an automotive suspension system, the consideration of the major loss only for the design model is well satisfied by experimental results. However, when an MR shock absorber is applied to dynamic systems that require high stroke velocity, such as aircraft landing gear systems, the minor loss effect becomes significant to the pressure drop. In this work, a new design model for an MR shock absorber, considering both the major and minor pressure losses, is proposed. After formulating a mathematical design model, a prototype of an MR shock absorber is manufactured based on the design parameters of a lightweight aircraft landing gear system. After establishing a drop test for the MR shock absorber, the results of the pressure drop versus stroke/stroke velocity are investigated at different impact energies. It is shown from comparative evaluation that the proposed design model agrees with the experiment much better than the model that considers only the major pressure loss.},

abstract={This work reports the self-organization of dimple nanostructures on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) surface where an Ar ion beam was irradiated at an ion energy of 600 eV. The peak-to-peak roughness and diameter of dimple nanostructures were 29.1~53.4 nm and 63.4~77.6 nm, respectively. The electron energy loss spectrum at the peaks and troughs of dimples showed similar C=C, C=O, and O=CH bonding statuses. In addition, wide-angle X-ray scattering showed that Ar ion beam irradiation did not induce crystallization of the PEN surface. That meant that the self-organization on the PEN surface could be due to the ion-induced surface instability of the amorphous layer and not due to the partial crystallinity differences of the peaks and valleys. A nonlinear continuum model described surface instability due to Ar ion-induced sputtering. The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model reproduced the dimple morphologies numerically, which was similar to the experimentally observed dimple patterns. This preliminary validation showed the possibility that the continuum equation used for metal and semiconductor surfaces could be applied to polymer surfaces where ion beam sputtering occurred.},

abstract={Background Arabic represents one of the most frequently spoken languages worldwide, especially among refugee populations. There is a pressing need for specialized diagnostic tools corresponding to the DSM-5 criteria in Modern Standard Arabic, which can be administered on Arabic speakers in the West and Arab region alike. Objectives To develop and validate the culturally-adapted version of the most recent M.I.N.I. 7.0.2 into Modern Standard Arabic—a form of Arabic commonly used across all Arab countries. Methods 102 participants were recruited between April 2019 to March 2020 at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin. Symptoms were assessed with Arabic versions of rater-based and self-rated measures, including Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Arabic-speaking psychiatrists saw participants for diagnostic assessment. Results Cohen’s kappa (κ) values were moderate for major depression, and slight for post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, kappa values indicated moderate agreement between M.I.N.I.-AR and PHQ-9 for depression, as well as HTQ for post-traumatic stress disorder, respectively. Conclusion The translated and culturally adapted version of the M.I.N.I. addresses an existing need for a reliable, efficient, and effective comprehensive diagnostic tool using the most recent DSM-5 criteria in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Based on the obtained results, only a validation of the depression module (Module A) of the M.I.N.I-AR was possible. Study outcomes also show evidence for the validation of Module H covering Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Potential valuable contributions can be extended to this translation and validation.},

abstract={Background We previously proposed a novel virtual reality-based method to assess human field of perception (FOP) and field of regard (FOR), termed the FOPR test. This study assessed the diagnostic validity of the FOPR test for hemispatial neglect (HSN). Methods We included 19 stroke patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere and with HSN (HSN+SS), 22 stroke patients with a lesion in the right hemisphere and without HSN (HSN−SS), and 22 healthy controls aged 19–65 years. The success rate (SR) and response time (RT) in the FOPR test for both FOP and FOR were assessed (FOP-SR, FOR-SR, FOP-RT, and FOR-RT, respectively). Using a Bland–Altman plot, agreements between the FOPR test and conventional tests were confirmed, and the FOPR test accuracy was verified using the support vector machine (SVM). Measured values were analysed using ANOVA and Kruskall–Wallis tests for group comparison. Results The Bland–Altman plot showed good agreement between FOPR test and conventional tests; individuals within 95% agreement limits were within the range of 94.8–100.0%. The SVM classification accuracy, using FOP and FOR variables from the left hemispace, ranged from 83.3 to 100.0% in a binary classification (HSN vs non-HSN). The FOPR test demonstrated differences in SR and RT for both FOP and FOR across the groups. Conclusion The FOPR test was valid for the HSN diagnosis and provided quantitative and intuitive information regarding visuospatial function. Furthermore, it might enhance our understanding of visuospatial function including HSN by applying the time relative component and concepts of perception and exploration, FOP and FOR.

abstract={It is very difficult to extract the feature frequency of the vibration signal of the rolling bearing early weak fault and in order to extract its feature frequency quickly and accurately. A method of extracting early weak fault vibration signal feature frequency of the rolling bearing by intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) and autoregression (AR) minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the original early weak fault vibration signal of the rolling bearing is decomposed by the ITD algorithm to proper rotations (PRs) with fault feature frequency. Then, the sample entropy value of each PR is calculated to find the largest PRs of the sample entropy. Finally, the AR-MED filtering algorithm is utilized to filter and reduce the noise of the largest PRs of the sample entropy value, and the early weak fault vibration signal feature frequency of the rolling bearing is accurately extracted. The results show that the ITD-AR-MED method can extract the early weak fault vibration signal feature frequency of the rolling bearing accurately.},

abstract={It is very important to extract the characteristic frequency of helicopter mechanical fault signal, which is directly related to the accuracy of fault diagnosis and the reliability of early fault prediction. The traditional characteristic frequency extraction of fault signal mostly uses the spectrum analysis method based on Fourier analysis. The algorithm of this method is simple, but has high requirements on SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and sampling time. In this paper, researchers use the AR model spectral estimation method based on the modern spectral estimation theory to study the characteristic frequency extraction of helicopter mechanical fault signal. The simulation results show that the effect is better.},

abstract={PurposeGlioma treatment planning requires precise tumor delineation, which is typically performed with contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI. However, CE MRI fails to reflect the entire extent of glioma. O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET may detect tumor volumes missed by CE MRI. We investigated the clinical value of simultaneous FET-PET and CE MRI in delineating tumor extent before treatment planning. Guided stereotactic biopsy was used to validate the findings.MethodsConventional MRI and 18F-FET PET were performed simultaneously on a hybrid PET/MR in 33 patients with histopathologically confirmed glioma. Tumor volumes were quantified using a tumor-to-brain ratio ≥ 1.6 (VPET) and a visual threshold (VCE). We visually assessed abnormal areas on FLAIR images and calculated Dice’s coefficient (DSC), overlap volume (OV), discrepancy-PET, and discrepancy-CE. Additionally, several stereotactic biopsy samples were taken from “matched” or “mismatched” FET-PET and CE MRI regions.ResultsAmong 31 patients (93.94%), FET-PET delineated significantly larger tumor volumes than CE MRI (77.84 ± 51.74 cm3 vs. 34.59 ± 27.07 cm3, P < 0.05). Of the 21 biopsy samples obtained from regions with increased FET uptake, all were histopathologically confirmed as glioma tissue or tumor infiltration, whereas only 13 showed enhancement on CE MRI. Among all patients, the spatial similarity between VPET and VCE was low (average DSC 0.56 ± 0.22), while the overlap was high (average OV 0.95 ± 0.08). The discrepancy-CE and discrepancy-PET were lower than 10% in 28 and 0 patients, respectively. Eleven patients showed VPET partially beyond abnormal signal areas on FLAIR images.ConclusionThe metabolically active biodistribution of gliomas delineated with FET-PET significantly exceeds tumor volume on CE MRI, and histopathology confirms these findings. Our preliminary results indicate that combining the anatomic and molecular information obtained from conventional MRI and FET-PET would reveal a more accurate glioma extent, which is critical for individualized treatment planning.},

abstract={In the linear regression model, the errors are usually assumed to be uncorrelated. However, in real-life data, this assumption is not often plausible. In this study, first, we will assume that the errors of the regression model have autoregressive structure. This type of regression models has been considered before. However, in those papers under this assumption usually, the symmetric distributions are used as error distribution. The main contribution of this work is to use skew distributions instead of symmetric distributions as error distribution in regression models with autoregressive errors. We provide expectation maximization algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters. The performances of the proposed estimators are demonstrated with a simulation study and a real data example. We also provide the confidence intervals using the observed Fisher information matrix for the corresponding estimators.},

abstract={Background: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) affect millions of people worldwide. Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ) is a valid and reliable tool to assess the health of patients with MSD. However, this scale is not available in the Arabic language. The purpose of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire (MSK-HQ) into Arabic (MSK-HQ-Ar) and evaluate its validity and reliability among participants with MSD. Methods: This cross-sectional study used guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) to translate as well as validate the psychometric properties of MSK-HQ-Ar. Patients with MSD (n = 149) living in Taif participated in the study. Cronbach’s alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to assess internal consistency and test-retest reliability of MSK-HQ-Ar respectively. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess the correlation between MSK-HQ-Ar and the European quality of life five-dimension, five-level scale (EQ-5D-5L). Results: Out of 149 participants, 119 completed the MSK-HQ-Ar twice. The scale showed good internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha (0.88), and reliability (ICC 0.92–0.95). A strong association was found with the EQ-5D-5L scores. Conclusion: The adapted MSK-HQ-Arabic version revealed acceptable psychometric properties and is a valid and reliable outcome measure to assess MSK health among Arabic speaking patients with MSD.},

abstract={Paranoia may build on negative beliefs held both about the self and others. Compassionate imagery may be one way of reducing such negative beliefs, and hence paranoia. Two studies tested this idea, one targeting compassion for the self and one targeting compassion for others. Two-hundred individuals from the general population scoring highly for paranoia were recruited. The studies used a randomised controlled experimental design, with embedded tests for mediation. Study one targeted self-compassion via creation of a compassionate coach (CC) image. Study two targeted compassion for others via loving kindness meditation (LKM). Individuals repeatedly entered neutral virtual reality social environments. Changes in compassion and paranoia were assessed. Compared to controls, the CC group increased in self-compassion (group difference = 2.12, C.I. = 1.57;2.67, p = <0.0001, d = 1.4) and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.73, C.I. = −2.48; −0.98, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in self-compassion explained 57% of change in paranoia. Compared to controls, the LKM group increased their compassion for others (group difference = 3.26, C.I. = 2.72;3.80, p = <0.0001, d = 1.7), and decreased in paranoia (group difference = −1.70, C.I. = −2.50; −0.89, p = <0.0001, d = 0.8). Change in compassion for others explained 67% of change in paranoia. Targeting negative beliefs about the self and others using compassionate imagery causes reductions in paranoia.

abstract={The Diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) requires an exhaustive and objective assessment in order to design an intervention that is adapted to the peculiarities of the patients. The present study aimed to determine if the most commonly used ADHD observation scale—the Evaluation of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity (EDAH) scale—is able to predict performance in a Continuous Performance Test based on Virtual Reality (VR-CPT). One-hundred-and-fifty students (76% boys and 24% girls) aged 6–16 (M = 10.35; DT = 2.39) participated in the study. Regression analyses showed that only the EDAH subscale referring to inattention symptoms, was a statistically significant predictor of performance in a VR-CPT. More specifically, this subscale showed 86.5% prediction-accuracy regarding performance in the Omissions variable, 80.4% in the Commissions variable, and 74.5% in the Response-time variable. The EDAH subscales referring to impulsivity and hyperactivity were not statistically significant predictors of any variables in the VR-CPT. Our findings may partially explain why impulsive-hyperactive and the combined presentations of ADHD might be considered as unique and qualitatively different sub-categories of ADHD. These results also highlighted the importance of measuring not only the observable behaviors of ADHD individuals, but also the scores in performance tests that are attained by the patients themselves.},

abstract={To evaluate a car’s design before its introduction to the market, automobile companies traditionally conduct customer surveys using clay models or real products. Recently, however, virtual reality (VR) has attracted significant attention as an efficient alternative to this costly and time-consuming practice. However, from the viewpoint of a customer’s intention to purchase, based on the design of the car, the differences between evaluations made using VR and by viewing an actual vehicle need to be clarified. In this study, the perception difference between actual space, VR space, and paper was verified with a randomized controlled trial involving four groups: (1) an actual car group, (2) a photographed VR group, (3) a computer-generated VR (CG VR) group, and (4) a paper group. By preparing the least expensive (paper) group, the usefulness of VR could be further clarified. The results showed that, whereas there is no perception difference for purchase intention and style attributes, there is a perception difference in terms of the factors underlying the purchase intention. The best way to convey the comfort of the interior space was CG VR, given that the size can be defined by data. Therefore, this was slightly advantageous over photograph-based VR, for which the interior size could not be defined. In addition, it became clear that it was very difficult to convey the amount of interior space using the paper-based method. These findings can help overcome the constraints of current design surveys and contribute to customer-oriented manufacturing.},

abstract={This paper examines the possibility of experiential learning in a virtual space using head-mounted-display-based immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies. Experiential learning refers to learning through direct experiences in the context of learning. Realistically, experiential learning is impossible in most cases, but VR technologies allowing direct interaction with virtual environments and objects are being developed and commercialized. These technologies are predicted to enhance vividness, interactivity, presence, flow, and experientiality, and increase the expectations of the possibility of experiential learning using VR. Thus, in this study, an experiment was conducted to verify such possibility. The analysis of the experiment results showed that the tactile interactivity and presence improved with the use of enhanced interaction technologies in VR, and in terms of experientiality, the experiment participants became highly aware of the “exploratory stage,” referring to the level of experience of being exposed to an interesting site and directly touching an object in the currently enhanced VR in providing direct tactile and locomotive interactivity. Furthermore, the fact that the learning effect is also partially enhanced was discovered. Accordingly, it was determined that experiential learning using VR is possible based on the experiment results, which showed that the enhanced vividness and interactivity of VR technologies allow the users to closely recognize virtual experiences as direct experiences, and that the learning effect is enhanced. It was also determined that experiential learning in a virtual environment that is identical to an experience in reality would be made possible in the near future based on continued technological development.},

abstract={PurposeMaximising the benefit of learning from defects is regarded by UK housing associations (HAs) as a key opportunity to meet their challenges of building more homes with reduced government funding and rent incomes. Despite learning from defects being a frequent recommendation to reduce defects in the construction literature, there is scarce empirical evidence into how HAs actually learn from defects. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how HAs learn from past defects and induce change to reduce defects.Design/methodology/approachGuided by organisational learning (OL) as the theoretical lens, a 21-month action research (AR) project explored one HA’s defects management and learning processes.FindingsOL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task which is reliant on a defects management team analysing defect data to identify priority areas. As such, learning from defects can be reduced due to peaks in workload if data analysis is a manual process. Furthermore, a dual learning approach plays a significant role for HA’s learning consisting of designing out defects (codification) supported by networking (personalisation) to tackle issues of workmanship on site and those defects that cannot be designed out.Originality/valueThis study demonstrates OL has the potential to reduce defects in new homes but is a secondary task in HA’s practice; and highlights the practical challenges of academia and industry co-production in AR in construction.},

abstract={ObjectivesIn utero magnetic resonance (iuMR) imaging to diagnose foetal brain abnormalities has been established and is supported by meta-analyses of retrospective and prospective studies. In this paper we describe and classify the iuMR errors made in the largest diagnostic accuracy study to date (MERIDIAN). We also correlate the error rates and types with the prior experience of the reporting radiologists in order to inform how to provide a national programme with the best diagnostic accuracy achievable.MethodsThe MERIDIAN cohort of 570 foetus formed the basis of this study and included 40 cases with a confirmed diagnostic error, compared with the Outcome Reference Diagnosis. Analysis included the potential clinical effect of the error and classification of error type through an Expert Neuroradiological Panel re-reporting the study. Assessments were made regarding radiologists experience prior to MERIDIAN.ResultsThe overall confirmed error rate for iuMR was 7·0% and it was considered that there would have been an adverse effect on prognostic information in 22/40 cases if the iuMR had informed counselling. The experienced central reporter made statistically significant fewer errors than the less experienced non-central reporters (3·8% v 11·0%) and the central reporter made fewer clinically significant errors. Furthermore, the type of cognitive errors differed between central and non-central reporters.ConclusionsAlthough iuMR imaging improves the diagnostic accuracy of detecting foetal brain abnormalities there remains a substantial error rate, which can have major clinical significance. We have shown that error rates are lower for more experienced reporting radiologists with fewer potential deleterious clinical implications. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of providing a uniform national service.Key Points• Overall confirmed error rate for iuMR diagnosing foetal brain abnormalities was 7·0%.• IuMR reports had an adverse effect on counselling in 55% of error cases.• Error rates are consistently lower for more experienced radiologists.• Collaboration between radiologists, dual reporting, overseeing scan and formal training can reduce errors.},

abstract={Background/Objective: Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) have demonstrated validity when differentiating children with ADHD from healthy controls. However, these CPTs have limitations such as low ecological validity. New CPTs based on the use of Virtual Reality (VR) have appeared as supposedly improved methods for assessing ADHD. This study aims to compare the discriminant value of attentional variables produced by a VR CPT (Aula Nesplora) with that of variables from a traditional CPT (Test of Variables of Attention; TOVA) for identifying ADHD. Method: A total of 338 children aged between 6 and 16 years old (M = 10.84, SD = 3.01) participated in the study: 31.95% correspond to the inattentive presentation, 15.38% to the impulsive-hyperactive presentation, 22.78% to the combined presentation, and the remaining 29.88% correspond to children without ADHD. Results: Results indicated that Aula Nesplora predicts ADHD presentations better than TOVA. It also differentiates better between ADHD and non-ADHD students. Conclusions: These findings show the potential advantages of using virtual reality in ADHD assessment, as it facilitates the diagnosis of ADHD and the differentiation of its presentations in a realistic environment.Alternate abstract:Antecedentes/objetivos: Los tests de ejecución continua (Continuous Perfomance Test; CPT) han mostrado utilidad en la diferenciación de los ninos con TDAH de los controles.

abstract={Background: Sørensen trunk extension endurance test performance predicts the development of low back pain and is a strong discriminator of those with and without low back pain. Performance may greatly depend on psychological factors, such as kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, and motivation. Virtual reality video games have been used in people with low back pain to encourage physical activity that would otherwise be avoided out of fear of pain or harm. Accordingly, we developed a virtual reality video game to assess the influence of immersive gaming on the Sørensen test performance. Objective: The objective of our study was to determine the physiological and psychological predictors of time to task failure (TTF) on a virtual reality Sørensen test in participants with and without a history of recurrent low back pain. Methods: We recruited 24 individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain and 24 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched individuals without a history of low back pain. Participants completed a series of psychological measures, including the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Pain Resilience Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and a self-efficacy measure. The maximal isometric strength of trunk and hip extensors and TTF on a virtual reality Sørensen test were measured. Electromyography of the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, and biceps femoris was recorded during the strength and endurance trials. Results: A two-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in TTF between groups (P=.99), but there was a trend for longer TTF in females on the virtual reality Sørensen test (P=.06). Linear regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of TTF in each group. In healthy participants, the normalized median power frequency slope of erector spinae (beta=.450, P=.01), biceps femoris (beta=.400, P=.01), and trunk mass (beta=−.32, P=.02) predicted TTF. In participants with recurrent low back pain, trunk mass (beta=−.67, P<.001), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (beta=−.43, P=.01), and self-efficacy (beta=.35, P=.03) predicted TTF. Conclusions: Trunk mass appears to be a consistent predictor of performance. Kinesiophobia appears to negatively influence TTF for those with a history of recurrent low back pain, but does not influence healthy individuals. Self-efficacy is associated with better performance in individuals with a history of recurrent low back pain, whereas a less steep median power frequency slope of the trunk and hip extensors is associated with better performance in individuals without a history of low back pain.},

abstract={Introduction Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) is a promising non-invasive imaging tool in viability and cardiomyopathy, quantifying infarct size more accurately than late-gadolinium enhancement, as we previously demonstrated. We aimed to validate MEMRI viability against 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET). Methods Sprague-Dawley rats (male; 180-300 g) underwent permanent surgical anterior myocardial infarction (n=11), or sham surgery (n=2), with dual MEMRI and 18F-FDG PET assessment at 12 weeks. MEMRI (7 T spectrometer, Agilent, UK) was achieved with intravenous manganese gluconate (EVP1001-1, Eagle-Vision-Pharmaceuticals, USA; n=6, 22 μmol/kg) and mangafodipir (Teslascan, IC-Targets, Norway; n=7, 44 μmol/kg). Anatomical and functional imaging preceded cardiac-gated Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MoLLI) before and 20 min post-contrast (at maximal infarct slice). Commercially available software generated standardised T1 maps for ROI-contouring. For PET imaging, intravenous 18F-FDG (20-30 MBq) was administered with PET data acquired for 60 min, followed by cardiac-gated acquisition (10 min). PET/MR images were co-registered and fused for analysis. Results Infarct size assessed by MEMRI T1 mapping was smaller than by native T1 at 12 weeks (mean 23.34 vs 18.68%; p=0.001). Native T1 mapping consistently overestimated infarct size (bias 25.76; 95% CI: 7.51 to 44.01; p=0.031) but there was excellent agreement between MEMRI T1 mapping and 18F-FDG (bias 1.30; 95% CI: -24.98 to 25.57; p=0.7). Post-MEMRI T1 values showed negative trend with increasing SUV (r2=0.25, p=0.08) whereas native T1 demonstrated no relationship (r2=0.0001, p>0.9). Conclusion MEMRI T1 mapping identifies viable myocardium as well as 18F-FDG PET and was superior to native T1 mapping. Post-MEMRI T1 appears related to SUV where native T1 does not. This validation data informs the clinical translation of cardiac MEMRI.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to compare the performance of positron emission tomography (PET) component of PET/computed tomography (CT) with new emerging PET/magnetic resonance (MR) of the same vendor. According to National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU2-07, five separate experimental tests were performed to evaluate the performance of PET scanner of General Electric GE company; SIGNATM model PET/MR and GE Discovery 710 model PET/CT. The main investigated aspects were spatial resolution, sensitivity, scatter fraction, count rate performance, image quality, count loss and random events correction accuracy. The findings of this study demonstrated superior sensitivity (~ 4 folds) of PET scanner in PET/MR compared to PET/CT system. Image quality test exhibited higher contrast in PET/MR (~ 9%) compared with PET/CT. The scatter fraction of PET/MR was 43.4% at noise equivalent count rate (NECR) peak of 218 kcps and the corresponding activity concentration was 17.7 kBq/cc. Whereas the scatter fraction of PET/CT was found as 39.2% at NECR peak of 72 kcps and activity concentration of 24.3 kBq/cc. The percentage error of the random event correction accuracy was 3.4% and 3.1% in PET/MR and PET/CT, respectively. It was concluded that PET/MR system is about 4 times more sensitive than PET/CT, and the contrast of hot lesions in PET/MR was ~ 9% higher than PET/CT. These outcomes also emphasize the possibility to achieve excellent clinical PET images with low administered dose and/or a short acquisition time in PET/MR.Alternate abstract:Bu çalışmada son yıllarda nükleer tıpta rutin uygulamaya giren pozitron emisyon tomografisi/manyetik rezonans (PET/ MR) görüntüleme sistemi ile PET/bilgisayarlı tomografi (BT) görüntüleme sistemlerinde 'National Electrical Manufacturers Association' (NEMA) testlerinin yapılması ve sonuçların karşılaştırılması amaçlandı.

abstract={Purpose The aim of this study was to translate and validate an Arabic version of the 5-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP). Methods A total of 320 subjects (aged 18 years and above) were consecutively recruited from dental clinics. The self-administered OHIP5-Ar was distributed and the data were collected and analyzed. The dimensionality of the instrument was investigated using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Reliability was assessed as the instruments internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest-reliability using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Convergent validity was tested by correlation between perceived global oral and general health questions with the latent factor (OHRQoL) using structural equation modelling analysis and with OHIP5-Ar total score using spearman’s correlation coefficient. Known-groups validity was tested among groups with known differences and sensitivity to change was also investigated after dental treatments. Results The OHIP5-Ar was fitted well in the unidimensional model as indicated by the CFA with fit indices (RMSEA: 0.00, SRMR: 0.010, GFI: 0.998, TLI: 1). Cronbach’s alpha was 0.78 and the ICC agreement was 0.88. The validity tests indicated satisfactory validity of the instrument and the sensitivity to change of the instrument revealed significant change in the OHIP5-Ar total score after the provision of dental treatments (effect sizes: 0.55–1.49). Conclusion The OHIP5-Ar showed satisfactory psychometric properties among Arabic-speaking population. This instrument is sensitive to the changes of oral health and can be used to measure the OHRQoL with one total score.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore differences in image quality between PET/MR and PET/CT hybrid imaging systems using standard quality control and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) tests. METHODS Image acquisition and quality control tests were investigated according to the standards of NEMA NU 2-2007 using NEMA phantom and recommended image acquisition techniques. The phantom consists of lesion-like hot spheres of diameters 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm filled with 8:1 18F activity ratio to background. The remaining 28 and 37 mm cold spheres were filled with water only. A 700-mm linear line source was prepared with 3.08 mCi (140.6 MBq), and all essential ROIs were drawn after image acquisition to calculate contrast. RESULTS In PET/MR, the average contrast of 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm diameter hot spheres in the phantom was 56%, 72%, 78%, and 85%, respectively. While the contrast of 10, 13, 17, and 22 mm diameter hot spheres in PET/CT was 53%, 66%, 72%, and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSION PET/MR image contrast was higher than PET/CT by 9%.},

abstract={The characteristics of a dual-pulse shock caused by an UNDEX (underwater explosion) are described through many standards. Shock signals required to evaluate the survivability of equipment by a shock test machine are also described. To generate various types of shock signals described in the standard, Shock test machines (STMs) require adjustment to various levels of shock occurring in surface ships and submarines. Therefore, the characteristics of each component of a STM should be changeable to generate various shock signals. This paper describes the concept of a STM that can generate various types of dual-pulse shocks. Moreover, this paper suggests an analytic method to determine the characteristics of each component of a STM to generate the required shock signal for various specimens. A method for adjusting the shock signals using a magnetorheological damper is specifically suggested. The results of dynamic analysis using the characteristic values of each component determined by this method shows that the required shock signal can be generated by this concept of the shock test machine.},

abstract={The Cenozoic geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Pontides Orogenic Belt (EPOB), which geographically corresponds to the northeastern part of Turkey, is still controversial due to lack of systematic geological, geochemical and chronological data. This paper provides new geochemical and chronological data from the Kuyucak and Erdembaba volcanics exposed along the North Anatolian Fault Zone, which is one of the most seismically-active intracontinental strike-slip fault systems on the globe, in the Reºadiye (Tokat) area that is situated in the southern part of the EPOB. Kuyucak volcanics consist predominantly of basaltic rocks including mainly olivine, augite and plagioclase. Erdembaba volcanics comprise mainly dacite and minor trachydacite-trachyandesite that are composed mainly of augite, plagioclase, hornblende and rarely biotite. The Geochemical properties of the Erdembaba volcanic define small amounts of magma mixing events and it follow a linear trend from a primitive end member through to upper crustal evolution. The ^sup 40^Ar/^sup 39^Ar age determinations of whole rock of volcanic rock samples yielded the ages ranging from 1.33 to 6.31 Ma (late Miocene- Pleistocene). Both groups display an enrichment in LIL and LREE elements relative to HFS and HREE elements, strong negative Nb and Ti anomalies. All geochemical and Ar/Ar chronological data indicate that the late Miocene Kuyucak volcanic rocks, which are characterized by low concentrations of SiO2 (<50 wt.%), were generated by mantlederived magmas that underwent contamination processes during their transfer to the surface. Whereas, Erdembaba volcanic rocks including high concentrations of SiO2 were derived from partial melting of the plunging continental crust beneath the Eurasian plate in Pliocene, after closure of Neotethys ocean that was situated in the southern part of the EPOB.},

Computer models were created using intra-operative US images, post-treatment follow-up MR images and clinical data from six patients receiving IRE. Isoelectric contours drawn using simulation results were compared with MR imaging to estimate the energy threshold separating treated and untreated tissue. Simulation estimates of injury to the neurovascular bundle and rectum were compared with clinical follow-up and patient reported outcomes. At the electric field strength of 700 V/cm, simulation estimated electric field distribution was not different from the ablation defect seen on follow-up MR imaging (p = 0.43). Simulation predicted cross sectional area of treatment (mean 532.33 ± 142.32 mm^sup 2^) corresponded well with the treatment zone seen on MR imaging (mean 540.16 ± 237.13 mm^sup 2^). Simulation results did not suggest injury to the rectum or neurovascular bundle, matching clinical follow-up at 3 months. Computer simulation estimated zone of irreversible electroporation in the prostate at 700 V/cm was comparable to measurements made on follow-up MR imaging.

abstract={The Jiaojia Fault (JJF) in the Jiaodong area of eastern China is an important NNE-trending structure that is subsidiary to the regional Tancheng-Lujiang (Tan-Lu) Fault Zone, and hosts >1200 t of gold reserves contained in disseminated and stockwork ore, dominantly in the footwall of the fault. We present new zircon U-Pb, apatite fission track, and illite K-Ar data along the JJF and have delineated its tectonic history focusing on its formation and reactivation. Zircon U-Pb dating shows that the Shangzhuang granite is a composite body with ages between 132±1 and 127±1 Ma. Illite K-Ar ages for the fault's gouge range from 83±2 to 68±2 Ma, and the measured apatite fission track ages for ores are between 55 and 21 Ma. Previous zircon U-Pb geochronology and structural studies suggest that the JJF was originally activated in the Jurassic during 160-150 Ma as a sinistral fault. The JJF was a normal fault in the Early Cretaceous due to NW-SE orientated tension and NE-SW compression, which lasted from 135 to 120 Ma. This was followed by sinistral strike-slip faulting due to NW-SE compression and NE-SW tension during 120-110 Ma, and it changed to normal displacement at ca. 110 Ma. Our apatite fission track data analysis and thermal modeling of representative samples suggest that there was a subsequent dextral reactivation of the fault at ca. 55 Ma. Previous age data of ca. 130-110 Ma for gold mineralization along the JJF coincides with the Early Cretaceous magmatism and is coeval with the transition from normal faulting to sinistral strike-slip faulting of the JJF in Early Cretaceous, which is interpreted to be due to changing direction of the subducting Pacific Plate.},

abstract={The EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI is distorted by a number of artefacts related to the presence of strong magnetic fields, which must be reduced in order to allow for a useful interpretation and quantification of the EEG data. For the two most prominent artefacts, associated with magnetic field gradient switching and the heart beat, reduction methods have been developed and applied successfully. However, a number of artefacts related to the MR-environment can be found to distort the EEG data acquired even without ongoing fMRI acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the most prominent of those artefacts, caused by the Helium cooling pump, and propose a method for its reduction and respective validation in data collected from epilepsy patients. Since the Helium cooling pump artefact was found to be repetitive, an average template subtraction method was developed for its reduction with appropriate adjustments for minimizing the degradation of the physiological part of the signal. The new methodology was validated in a group of 15 EEG-fMRI datasets collected from six consecutive epilepsy patients, where it successfully reduced the amplitude of the artefact spectral peaks by 95 ± 2 % while the background spectral amplitude within those peaks was reduced by only -5 ± 4 %. Although the Helium cooling pump should ideally be switched off during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions, we have shown here that in cases where this is not possible the associated artefact can be effectively reduced in post processing.},

abstract={Radio-frequency coil arrays using dipole antenna technique have been recently applied for ultrahigh field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to obtain the better signal–noise-ratio (SNR) gain at the deep area of human tissues. However, the unique structure of dipole antennas makes it challenging to achieve sufficient electromagnetic decoupling among the dipole antenna elements. Currently, there is no decoupling methods proposed for dipole antenna arrays in MR imaging. The recently developed magnetic wall (MW) or induced current elimination decoupling technique has demonstrated its feasibility and robustness in designing microstrip transmission line arrays, L/C loop arrays and monopole arrays. In this study, we aim to investigate the possibility and performance of MW decoupling technique in dipole arrays for MR imaging at the ultrahigh field of 7T. To achieve this goal, a two-channel MW decoupled dipole array was designed, constructed and analyzed experimentally through bench test and MR imaging. Electromagnetic isolation between the two dipole elements was improved from about −3.6 dB (without any decoupling treatments) to −16.5 dB by using the MW decoupling method. MR images acquired from a water phantom using the MW decoupled dipole array and the geometry factor maps were measured, calculated and compared with those acquired using the dipole array without decoupling treatments. The MW decoupled dipole array demonstrated well-defined image profiles from each element and had better geometry factor over the array without decoupling treatments. The experimental results indicate that the MW decoupling technique might be a promising solution to reducing the electromagnetic coupling of dipole arrays in ultrahigh field MRI, consequently improving their performance in SNR and parallel imaging.},

abstract={Objectives In cases of “spina bifida,” a detailed prenatal imaging assessment of the exact morphology of neural tube defects (NTD) is often limited. Due to the diverse clinical prognosis and prenatal treatment options, imaging parameters that support the prenatal differentiation between open and closed neural tube defects (ONTDs and CNTDs) are required. This fetal MR study aims to evaluate the clivus-supraocciput angle (CSA) and the maximum transverse diameter of the posterior fossa (TDPF) as morphometric parameters to aid in the reliable diagnosis of either ONTDs or CNTDs. Methods The TDPF and the CSA of 238 fetuses (20–37 GW, mean: 28.36 GW) with a normal central nervous system, 44 with ONTDS, and 13 with CNTDs (18–37 GW, mean: 24.3 GW) were retrospectively measured using T2-weighted 1.5 Tesla MR -sequences. Results Normal fetuses showed a significant increase in the TDPF (r = .956; p<.001) and CSA (r = .714; p<.001) with gestational age. In ONTDs the CSA was significantly smaller (p<.001) than in normal controls and CNTDs, whereas in CNTDs the CSA was not significantly smaller than in controls (p = .160). In both ONTDs and in CNTDs the TDPF was significantly different from controls (p<.001). Conclusions The skull base morphology in fetuses with ONTDs differs significantly from cases with CNTDs and normal controls. This is the first study to show that the CSA changes during gestation and that it is a reliable imaging biomarker to distinguish between ONTDs and CNTDs, independent of the morphology of the spinal defect.},

In 235 consecutive patients aged 65.7±7.9 years; median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 8 ng/ml] with multiparametric prostate MRI (mp-MRI), 566 lesions were scored according to PI-RADS. Histology of all lesions was obtained by targeted MR-guided in-bore biopsy. In 200 lesions, biopsy revealed prostate cancer (PCa). The area under the curve (AUC) for cancer detection was 0.70 (T2WI), 0.80 (DWI), and 0.74 (DCE). A combination of T2WI + DWI, T2WI + DCE, and DWI + DCE achieved an AUC of 0.81, 0.78, and 0.79. A summed PI-RADS score of T2WI + DWI + DCE achieved an AUC of 0.81. For higher grade PCa (primary Gleason pattern≥4), the AUC was 0.85 for T2WI + DWI, 0.84 for T2WI + DCE, 0.86 for DWI + DCE, and 0.87 for T2WI + DWI + DCE. The AUC for T2WI + DWI + DCE for transitional-zone PCa was 0.73, and for the peripheral zone 0.88. Regarding higher-grade PCa, AUC for transitional-zone PCa was 0.88, and for peripheral zone 0.96. The combination of T2WI + DWI + DCE achieved the highest test accuracy, especially in patients with higher-grade PCa. The use of <=2 MR sequences led to lower AUC in higher-grade and peripheral-zone cancers. * T2WI + DWI + DCE achieved the highest accuracy in patients with higher grade PCa * T2WI + DWI + DCE was more accurate for peripheral- than for transitional-zone PCa * DCE increased PCa detection accuracy in the peripheral zone * DWI was the leading sequence in the transitional zone PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={To measure the test-retest reproducibility of an automated system for quantifying whole body and compartmental muscle volumes using wide bore 3 T MRI. Thirty volunteers stratified by body mass index underwent whole body 3 T MRI, two-point Dixon sequences, on two separate occasions. Water-fat separation was performed, with automated segmentation of whole body, torso, upper and lower leg volumes, and manually segmented lower leg muscle volumes. Mean automated total body muscle volume was 19·32 L (SD9·1) and 19·28 L (SD9·12) for first and second acquisitions (Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=1·0, 95 % level of agreement -0·32-0·2 L). ICC for all automated test-retest muscle volumes were almost perfect (0·99-1·0) with 95 % levels of agreement 1.8-6.6 % of mean volume. Automated muscle volume measurements correlate closely with manual quantification (right lower leg: manual 1·68 L (2SD0·6) compared to automated 1·64 L (2SD 0·6), left lower leg: manual 1·69 L (2SD 0·64) compared to automated 1·63 L (SD0·61), correlation coefficients for automated and manual segmentation were 0·94-0·96). Fully automated whole body and compartmental muscle volume quantification can be achieved rapidly on a 3 T wide bore system with very low margins of error, excellent test-retest reliability and excellent correlation to manual segmentation in the lower leg. * Sarcopaenia is an important reversible complication of a number of diseases. * Manual quantification of muscle volume is time-consuming and expensive. * Muscles can be imaged using in and out of phase MRI. * Automated atlas-based segmentation can identify muscle groups. * Automated muscle volume segmentation is reproducible and can replace manual measurements.

abstract={We introduce a method for the detailed interpretation of K-Ar illite fine-fraction ages of fault gouges from non-sedimentary host rocks. Ages are cross-evaluated with several independent parameters, e.g. illite crystallinity, illite polytype quantification, grain size, mineralogical observations, K-Ar muscovite and biotite host-rock cooling ages as well as low-temperature thermochronological data (AFT, AHe, ZHe). This interpretation approach is applied to a regional study in order to constrain the 'deformation path' of the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas in NW Argentina. In the course of this study, a large number of gouge-bearing fault zones were systematically sampled and analysed. Obtained K-Ar illite fine-fraction ages range from Devonian to Cretaceous times, documenting a long-lasting brittle fault activity in this region. Ages >320 Ma are synchronous with a period of intra-Carboniferous compressional tectonism, whereas Permo-Triassic ages are contemporaneous to a flat-slab subduction episode of the Farallon plate beneath the South American plate. Middle to Late Permian and Early Triassic ages as well as Early Jurassic to Middle Cretaceous ages correlate with extensional tectonics in this region. Additionally, K-Ar illite ages reveal a propagation of brittle deformation from north to south in the Sierras de Córdoba and San Luis. Data integrity and consistency with other chronometers and geological evidence show that the here suggested interpretation is valid and can provide a powerful tool to evaluate cooling and deformation histories. Despite of that, we could show that the reliability of fault gouge data strongly depends on the regional cooling.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Background Reconstruction methods for Non-Cartesian magnetic resonance imaging have often been analyzed using the root mean square error (RMSE). However, RMSE is not able to measure the level of structured error associated with the reconstruction process. Methods An index for geometric information loss was presented using the 2D autocorrelation function. The performances of Least Squares Non Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (LS-NUFFT) and gridding reconstruction (GR) methods were compared. The Direct Summation method (DS) was used as reference. For both methods, RMSE and the loss in geometric information were calculated using a digital phantom and a hyperpolarized13C dataset. Results The performance of the geometric information loss index was analyzed in the presence of noise. Comparing to GR, LS-NUFFT obtained a lower RMSE, but its error image appeared more structured. This was observed in both phantom and in vivo experiments. Discussion The evaluation of geometric information loss together with the reconstruction error was important for an appropriate performance analysis of the reconstruction methods. The use of geometric information loss was helpful to determine that LS-NUFFT loses relevant information in the reconstruction process, despite the low RMSE.},

The rheometer design enables to measure the rheological properties of MR fluid and to expose it to a long-term loading simultaneously, without any manipulation of the measured sample. During the durability test a change of the two most important parameters of Bingham model describing the behavior of MR fluids can be followed – dynamic viscosity and yield stress. In this paper the yield stress and viscosity were evaluated depending on temperature in OFF-state. The results show a significant change of yield strength during durability test depending on temperature of loading. Dependence of yield stress on temperature was proved. The viscosity decreased by 36% from its initial value after the dissipation of 9÷20kJcm−3 from total 1.2 MJcm−3 and then has remained the same until the end of durability test. Viscosity was evaluated depending on temperature.},

abstract={Introduction Low muscle mass secondary to disease and ageing is an important cause of excess mortality and morbidity. Many studies include a MR brain scan but no peripheral measure of muscle mass. We developed a technique to measure posterior neck muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) on volumetric MR brain scans enabling brain and muscle size to be measured simultaneously. Methods We performed four studies to develop and test: feasibility, inter-rater reliability, repeatability and external validity. We used T1-weighted MR brain imaging from young and older subjects, obtained on different scanners, and collected mid-thigh MR data. Results After developing the technique and demonstrating feasibility, we tested it for inter-rater reliability in 40 subjects. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between raters were 0.99 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.98–1.00) for the combined group (trapezius, splenius and semispinalis), 0.92 (CI 0.85–0.96) for obliquus and 0.92 (CI 0.85–0.96) for sternocleidomastoid. The first unrotated principal component explained 72.2% of total neck muscle CSA variance and correlated positively with both right (r = 0.52, p = .001) and left (r = 0.50, p = .002) grip strength. The 14 subjects in the repeatability study had had two MR brain scans on three different scanners. The ICC for between scanner variation for total neck muscle CSA was high at 0.94 (CI 0.86–0.98). The ICCs for within scanner variations were also high, with values of 0.95 (CI 0.86–0.98), 0.97 (CI 0.92–0.99) and 0.96 (CI 0.86–0.99) for the three scanners. The external validity study found a correlation coefficient for total thigh CSA and total neck CSA of 0.88. Discussion We present a feasible, valid and reliable method for measuring neck muscle CSA on T1-weighted MR brain scans. Larger studies are needed to validate and apply our technique with subjects differing in age, ethnicity and geographical location.},

abstract={Magnetic resonance‐guided high‐intensity focused ultrasound (MR‐HIFU) is a noninvasive image‐guided technique used to thermally ablate solid tumors. During treatment, ultrasound reflections from distal media interfaces can shift prescribed treatment locations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of normal incidence reflections from air, acrylic (modeling bone), and rubber on treatment location, temperature elevation, and heating patterns by performing ultrasound exposures in a tissue‐mimicking phantom and in ex vivo porcine tissue using a clinical MR‐HIFU platform. The results demonstrated a shift in treatment location toward the distal interface when targeted closer than 2 cm from the interface, especially for acrylic. Our study demonstrated that the ultrasound wave reflections from a distal air interface had less effect than the acrylic interface (modeling bone) on the heating pattern and focal location. This study provides useful information to better understand the limitations and safety concerns of performing MR‐HIFU treatments with commercial clinical equipment.PACS numbers: 87.61.‐c, 87.63.D},

abstract={In this paper, we discuss tests of heteroscedasticity and/or autocorrelation in nonlinear models with AR(1) and symmetrical errors. The symmetrical errors distribution class includes all symmetrical continuous distributions, such as normal, Student-t, power exponential, logistic I and II, contaminated normal, so on. First, score test statistics and their adjustment forms of heteroscedasticity are derived. Then, the asymptotic properties, including asymptotic chi-square and approximate powers under local alternatives of the score tests, are studied. The properties of test statistics are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, a real data set is used to illustrate our test methods. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging-based motion and deformation tracking techniques combined with finite element (FE) analysis are a powerful method for soft tissue constitutive model parameter identification. However, deriving deformation data from MR images is complex and generally requires validation. In this paper a validation method is presented based on a silicone gel phantom containing contrasting spherical markers. Tracking of these markers provides a direct measure of deformation. Validation of in vivo medical imaging techniques is often challenging due to the lack of appropriate reference data and the validation method may lack an appropriate reference. This paper evaluates a validation method using simulated MR image data. This provided an appropriate reference and allowed different error sources to be studied independently and allowed evaluation of the method for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The geometric bias error was between 0-5.560×10-3 voxels while the noisy magnitude MR image simulations demonstrated errors under 0.1161 voxels (SNR: 5-35).},

abstract={This paper investigates the sensing capability of an Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) system that is incorporated in a vibration control system based on MR fluid dampers. The EMI system, consisting of permanent magnets and coils, converts reciprocal motions (kinetic energy) of MR damper into electrical energy (electromotive force or emf). According to the Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, the emf signal, produced from the EMI, is proportional to the velocity of the motion. Thus, the induced voltage (emf) signal is able to provide the necessary measurement information (i.e., relative velocity across the damper). In other words, the EMI can act as a sensor in the MR damper system. In order to evaluate the proposed concept of the EMI sensor, an EMI system was constructed and integrated into an MR damper system. The emf signal is experimentally compared with the velocity signal by conducting a series of shaking table tests. The results show that the induced emf voltage signal well agreed with the relative velocity.},

abstract={The progression of neurodegenerative diseases as well as healthy aging is accompanied by structural changes of the brain. These changes are often only subtle when considered over time intervals of several months. Therefore morphometrical techniques for their detection in longitudinally acquired MR images must be highly sensitive, and they require a careful validation. In the present study, a novel processing chain for a longitudinal analysis based on deformation field morphometry is described. Procedures for its quantitative validation are also reported: Deformation fields were computed for the simulation of non-linear, local structural changes of human brains. Applying these deformation fields to "original" MR images yielded deformed MR images. The volume changes defined by the deformation fields represented the standard, against which the results of the longitudinal analysis of each pair of original and deformed MR image were compared. The proposed processing chain enabled to localize and to quantify simulated local atrophies near the cortex as well as in deep brain structures. An exemplary analysis of serial MR images of a patient suffering from an atypical Parkinson syndrome (cortico-basal degeneration, CBD) and healthy control subjects is presented, showing a characteristic pattern of volume changes in the brain of the patient which is strikingly different from the controls' patterns of changes.},

abstract={Robotic surgery is an accepted adjunct to minimally invasive surgery, but training is restricted to console time. Virtual-reality (VR) simulation has been shown to be effective for laparoscopic training and so we seek to validate a novel VR robotic simulator. The American Urological Association (AUA) Office of Education approved this study. Subjects enrolled in a robotics training course at the 2007 AUA annual meeting underwent skills training in a da Vinci dry-lab module and a virtual-reality robotics module which included a three-dimensional (3D) VR robotic simulator. Demographic and acceptability data were obtained, and performance metrics from the simulator were compared between experienced and nonexperienced roboticists for a ring transfer task. Fifteen subjects—four with previous robotic surgery experience and 11 without—participated. Nine subjects were still in urology training and nearly half of the group had reported playing video games. Overall performance of the da Vinci system and the simulator were deemed acceptable by a Likert scale (0–6) rating of 5.23 versus 4.69, respectively. Experienced subjects outperformed nonexperienced subjects on the simulator on three metrics: total task time (96 s versus 159 s, P < 0.02), economy of motion (1,301 mm versus 2,095 mm, P < 0.04), and time the telemanipulators spent outside of the center of the platform’s workspace (4 s versus 35 s, P < 0.02). This is the first demonstration of face and construct validity of a virtual-reality robotic simulator. Further studies assessing predictive validity are ultimately required to support incorporation of VR robotic simulation into training curricula.},

A total of 3584 individual ORFs (85%) have been successfully cloned into the entry plasmids. To validate the use of the clone set, three sets of ORFs were examined within three different destination vectors constructed in this study. Success rates for heterologous protein expression of S. oneidensis His- or His/GST- tagged proteins in E. coli were approximately 70%. The ArcA and NarP transcription factor proteins were tested in an in vitro binding assay to demonstrate that functional proteins can be successfully produced using the clone set. Further functional validation of the clone set was obtained from phage display experiments in which a phage encoding thioredoxin was successfully isolated from a pool of 80 different clones after three rounds of biopanning using immobilized anti-thioredoxin antibody as a target. This clone set complements existing genomic (e.g., whole-genome microarray) and other proteomic tools (e.g., mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis), and facilitates a wide variety of integrated studies, including protein expression, purification, and functional analyses of proteins both in vivo and in vitro.},

abstract={An accurate autoregressive (AR) model can reflect the characteristics of a dynamic system based on which the fault feature of gear vibration signal can be extracted without constructing mathematical model and studying the fault mechanism of gear vibration system, which are experienced by the time-frequency analysis methods. However, AR model can only be applied to stationary signals, while the gear fault vibration signals usually present nonstationary characteristics. Therefore, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which can decompose the vibration signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), is introduced into feature extraction of gear vibration signals as a preprocessor before AR models are generated. On the other hand, by targeting the difficulties of obtaining sufficient fault samples in practice, support vector machine (SVM) is introduced into gear fault pattern recognition. In the proposed method in this paper, firstly, vibration signals are decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions, then the AR model of each IMF component is established; finally, the corresponding autoregressive parameters and the variance of remnant are regarded as the fault characteristic vectors and used as input parameters of SVM classifier to classify the working condition of gears. The experimental analysis results show that the proposed approach, in which IMF AR model and SVM are combined, can identify working condition of gears with a success rate of 100% even in the case of smaller number of samples.},

abstract={Objective To determine whether the size of a perfusion defect seen at myocardial perfusion MR imaging represents the extent of irreversibly damaged myocardium in acute reperfused myocardial infarction. Materials and Methods In nine cats, reperfused myocardial infarction was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 90 minutes and subsequent reperfusion for 90 minutes. At single-slice myocardial perfusion MR imaging at the midventricular level using a turbo-FLASH sequence, 60 short-axis images were sequentially obtained with every heart beat after bolus injection of gadomer-17. The size of the perfusion defect was measured and compared with both the corresponding unstained area seen at triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and the hyperenhanced area seen at gadophrin-2-enhanced MR imaging performed in the same cat six hours after myocardial perfusion MR imaging. Results The sizes of perfusion defects seen at gadomer-17-enhanced perfusion MR imaging, unstained areas at TTC staining, and hyperenhanced areas at gadophrin-2-enhanced MR imaging were 20.4 ± 4.3%, 29.0 ± 9.7%, and 30.7 ± 10.6% of the left ventricular myocardium, respectively. The perfusion defects seen at myocardial perfusion MR imaging were significantly smaller than the unstained areas at TTC staining and hyperenhanced areas at gadophrin-2-enhanced MR imaging (pr = .64, p = .062 and r = .70, p = .035, respectively). Conclusion In this cat model, the perfusion defect revealed by myocardial perfusion MR imaging underestimated the true size of acute reperfused myocardial infarction. The defect may represent a more severely damaged area of infarction and probably has prognostic significance.},

The problems associated with high defect density and the presence of damaged region in the as-implanted material are overcome by CC-TATS method. The CC-TATS spectra of the as-implanted sample shows two positive peaks and an attendant negative peak. Two distinct traps have also been identified using thermally stimulated capacitance method modified to operate in constant capacitance mode. Variable pulse width measurements using CC-TATS show exponential capture kinetics in contrast to extremely slow capture observed in conventional deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) experiment. The results indicate that trapping behaviour is due to point-like defects associated with extended defects such as dislocation and stacking fault.},
