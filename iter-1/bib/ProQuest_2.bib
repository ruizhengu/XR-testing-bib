abstract={ObjectivesTo evaluate whether lung perfusion continues to be reduced in 10-year-old children after congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and whether lung perfusion values correlate with spirometric lung function measurements.MethodsFifty-four patients after CDH repair received dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based lung perfusion measurements at the age of 10 years (10.2 ± 1.0 years). Additionally, a control group of 10 children has been examined according to the same protocol. Lung spirometry was additionally available in 43 patients of the CDH group. A comparison of ipsilateral and contralateral parameters was performed.ResultsPulmonary blood flow (PBF) was reduced on the ipsilateral side in CDH patients (60.4 ± 23.8 vs. 93.3 ± 16.09 mL/100 mL/min; p < 0.0001). In comparison to the control group, especially the ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral, PBF was reduced in CDH patients (0.669 ± 0.152 vs. 0.975 ± 0.091; p < 0.0001). There is a positive correlation between ipsilateral pulmonary blood flow, and spirometric forced 1-s volume (r = 0.45; p = 0.0024).ConclusionsPulmonary blood flow impairment persists during childhood and correlates with spirometric measurements. Without the need for ionizing radiation, MRI measurements seem promising as follow-up parameters after CDH.Key Points• Ten-year-old children after congenital diaphragmatic hernia continue to show reduced perfusion of ipsilateral lung.• Lung perfusion values correlate with lung function tests after congenital diaphragmatic hernia.},

abstract={Magnetic rings are widely used in automotive, home appliances, and consumer electronics. Due to the materials used, processing techniques, and other factors, there will be top cracks, internal cracks, adhesion, and other defects on individual magnetic rings during the manufacturing process. To find such defects, the most sophisticated YOLOv5 target identification algorithm is frequently utilized. However, it has problems such as high computation, sluggish detection, and a large model size. This work suggests an enhanced lightweight YOLOv5 (MR-YOLO) approach for the identification of magnetic ring surface defects to address these issues. To decrease the floating-point operation (FLOP) in the feature channel fusion process and enhance the performance of feature expression, the YOLOv5 neck network was added to the Mobilenetv3 module. To improve the robustness of the algorithm, a Mosaic data enhancement technique was applied. Moreover, in order to increase the network’s interest in minor defects, the SE attention module is inserted into the backbone network to replace the SPPF module with substantially more calculations. Finally, to further increase the new network’s accuracy and training speed, we substituted the original CIoU-Ioss for SIoU-Loss. According to the test, the FLOP and Params of the modified network model decreased by 59.4% and 47.9%, respectively; the reasoning speed increased by 16.6%, the model’s size decreased by 48.1%, and the mAP only lost by 0.3%. The effectiveness and superiority of this method are proved by an analysis and comparison of examples.},

abstract={A critical chemotherapeutic complication is cardiotoxicity, often leading, in time, to heart failure. In this work, we developed a novel animal protocol using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and electrophysiology (EP) tests, designed to detect subtle structural and functional changes associated with myocardial damage in sub-chronic phases post-chemotherapy. A weekly dose of doxorubicin (DOX) was injected in four juvenile swine throughout a four-week plan, using an intravenous approach that mimics the treatment in cancer patients. We performed cardiac MR imaging as follows: in all four pigs pre-DOX; at 1 and 5 weeks post-DOX in a group of two pigs; and, at 1 and 9 weeks post-DOX in the other two pigs, using Cine imaging to assess ejection fraction (EF) and late gadolinium enhancement to quantify collagen density in the left ventricle. Additionally, X-ray-guided voltage mapping and arrhythmia tests were conducted in the group at 9 weeks post-DOX and in a healthy pig. Tissue samples were collected for histology. The results showed that EF decreased from ~46% pre-DOX to ~34% within the first 9 weeks post-DOX. This decline in LV function was explained by a gradual increase in collagen density, especially noticeable at week 9 post-DOX as derived from MRI analysis. Furthermore, ventricular fibrillation was induced via rapid pacing at 9 weeks post-DOX, most likely caused by fibrotic patches identified in voltage maps, as confirmed by MRI and collagen-sensitive histological stains. Overall, our novel preclinical protocol was able to reveal key signs of potentially-irreversible tissue changes, along with electrical remodeling and arrhythmia risk in the early months following DOX therapy. Future work will include more datasets to statistically power the study, and will use the protocol to test cardioprotective strategies.},

abstract={DC arc faults are dangerous to photovoltaic (PV) systems and can cause serious electric fire hazards and property damage. Because the PV inverter works in a high−frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) control mode, the arc fault detection is prone to nuisance tripping due to PV inverter noises. An arc fault detection method based on the autoregressive (AR) model is proposed. A test platform collects the database of this research according to the UL1699B standard, in which three different types of PV inverters are taken into consideration to make it more generalized. The arc current can be considered a nonstationary random signal while the noise of the PV inverter is not. According to the difference in randomness features between an arc and the noise, a detection method based on the AR model is proposed. The Burg algorithm is used to determine model coefficients, while the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is applied to explore the best order of the proposed model. The correlation coefficient difference of the model coefficients plays a role as a criterion to identify if there is an arc fault. Moreover, a prototype circuit based on the TMS320F28033 MCU is built for algorithm verification. Test results show that the proposed algorithm can identify an arc fault without a false positive under different PV inverter conditions. The fault clearing time is between 60 ms to 80 ms, which can meet the requirement of 200 ms specified by the standard.},

abstract={Shared automated mobility on-demand (SAMOD) is considered as a promising mobility solution in the future. Users book trips on-demand via a smartphone, and service algorithms set up virtual stops (vStop) where users then need to walk to board the automated shuttle. Navigation and identification of the virtual pickup location, which has no references in the real world, can be challenging. Providing users with an intuitive information system in that situation is essential to achieve high user acceptance of new automated mobility services. Our novel vStop human–machine interface (HMI) prototype for mobile augmented reality (AR) supports users with information in reference to the street environment. This work firstly presented the results of an online interview study (N = 21) to conceptualize an HMI. Secondly, the HMI was prototyped by means of AR and evaluated (N = 45) regarding user experience (UX), workload, and acceptance. The results show that the AR prototype provided high rates of UX especially in terms of high pragmatic quality. Furthermore, cognitive workload when using the HMI was low, and acceptance ratings were high. The results show the positive perception of AR for navigation tasks in general and the highly assistive character of the vStop prototype in particular. In the future, SAMOD services can provide customers with vStop HMIs to foster user acceptance and smooth operation of their service.},

abstract={Spatial navigation impairments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been suggested to underlie patients experiencing spatial disorientation. Though many studies have highlighted navigation impairments for AD patients in virtual reality (VR) environments, the extent to which these impairments predict a patient’s risk for spatial disorientation in the real world is still poorly understood. The aims of this study were to (a) investigate the spatial navigation abilities of AD patients in VR environments as well as in a real world community setting and (b) explore whether we could predict patients at a high risk for spatial disorientation in the community based on their VR navigation. Sixteen community-dwelling AD patients and 21 age/gender matched controls were assessed on their egocentric and allocentric navigation abilities in VR environments using the Virtual Supermarket Test (VST) and Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) as well as in the community using the Detour Navigation Test (DNT). When compared to controls, AD patients exhibited impairments on the VST, SHQ, and DNT. For patients, only SHQ wayfinding distance and wayfinding duration significantly predicted composite disorientation score on the DNT (β = 0.422, p = 0.034, R2 = 0.299 and β = 0.357, p = 0.046, R2 = 0.27 respectively). However, these same VR measures could not reliably predict which patients were at highest risk of spatial disorientation in the community (p > 0.1). Future studies should focus on developing VR-based tests which can predict AD patients at high risk of getting spatially disorientated in the real world.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of upper-limb robot-assisted therapy based on visual error augmentation in virtual reality (UL-RAT-VEAVR) for motor recovery and kinematics after chronic hemiparetic stroke. This study applied a single-group pre- and post-intervention study design. A total of 27 stroke survivors (20 males and 7 females; mean age 54.51 years, mean onset duration 12.7 months) volunteered to participate in this study. UL-RAT-VEAVR was performed three times a week for four weeks, amounting to a total of twelve sessions, in which an end-effector-based robotic arm was used with a visual display environment in virtual reality. Each subject performed a total of 480 point-to-point movements toward 3 direction targets (medial, ipsilateral, and contralateral side) in the visual display environment system while holding the handle of the end-effector-based robotic arm. The visual error (distance to the targets on the monitor) in virtual reality was increased by 5% every week based on the subject’s maximum point-to-point reaching trajectory. Upper-limb motor recovery was measured in all subjects using the Fugl–Meyer Assessment (FMA) upper-limb subscale, the Box and Block Test (BBT), and the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), before and after training. In addition, a kinematic assessment was also performed before and after training and consisted of time, speed, distance, and curvilinear ratio for point-to-point movement. There were significant improvements in both upper-limb motor function and kinematics after 4 weeks of UL-RAT-VEAVR (p < 0.05). Our results showed that the UL-RAT-VEAVR may have the potential to be used as one of the upper-limb rehabilitation strategies in chronic stroke survivors. Future studies should investigate the clinical effects of the error-augmentation paradigm using an RCT design.},

abstract={In order to solve the poor matching ability between concrete structures of traditional architectural space optimization design methods, it leads to the problem of low space optimization ratio, so based on virtual reality technology, the author proposes a new method for optimizing the space of concrete structure buildings. Using virtual reality technology to improve the basic structure of building space, reorganize the form through the design space, and optimize the design of the concrete structure building space function; based on the test model of virtual reality technology, design the matching method of concrete structure, increase the proportion of building space optimization, and adopt linear buckling method, geometric nonlinear method, and double nonlinear analysis method; the ultimate bearing capacity of steel structures of residential buildings in earthquake areas is tested. Experimental results show that for the simple structure building space, the average optimization ratios are 97.17% and 96.71%, respectively; for the complex structure building space, under the proposed optimization design, the average optimization ratio is maintained at 94.34%, and the error between the stress prediction value of the finite element model and the axial stress obtained by testing is less than 6%. Compared with the traditional space optimization design, in the proposed space optimization design method, the proportion of building space optimization is higher; it can be seen that the virtual reality technology has a better matching effect on the concrete structure, and the accuracy of the ultimate bearing capacity value obtained by prediction is high.},

abstract={We studied whether TOF reduces error propagation from attenuation correction to PET image reconstruction in PET/MR neuroimaging, by using imperfect attenuation maps in a clinical PET/MR system with 525 ps timing resolution. Ten subjects who had undergone 18F-FDG PET neuroimaging were included. Attenuation maps using a single value (0.100 cm−1) with and without air, and a 3-class attenuation map with soft tissue (0.096 cm−1), air and bone (0.151 cm−1) were used. CT-based attenuation correction was used as a reference. Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was conducted. Mean bias and standard deviation across the brain was studied. Regional correlations and concordance were evaluated. Statistical testing was conducted. Average bias and standard deviation were slightly reduced in the majority (23–26 out of 35) of the VOI with TOF. Bias was reduced near the cortex, nasal sinuses, and in the mid-brain with TOF. Bland–Altman and regression analysis showed small improvements with TOF. However, the overall effect of TOF to quantitative accuracy was small (3% at maximum) and significant only for two attenuation maps out of three at 525 ps timing resolution. In conclusion, TOF might reduce the quantitative errors due to attenuation correction in PET/MR neuroimaging, but this effect needs to be further investigated on systems with better timing resolution.},

abstract={Background After a stroke, experts recommend regular monitoring and kinematic assessments of patients to objectively measure motor recovery. With the rise of new technologies and increasing needs for neurorehabilitation, an interest in virtual reality has emerged. In this context, we have developed an immersive virtual reality version of the Box and Block Test (BBT-VR). The aim of this study was to assess the concurrent validity of the BBT-VR among patients with stroke and healthy participants. Methods Twenty-three healthy participants and 22 patients with stroke were asked to perform the classical Box and Block Test (BBT) and BBT-VR three times with both hands. Concurrent validity was assessed through correlations between these two tests and reliability of the BBT-VR through correlation on test–retest. Usability of the BBT-VR was also evaluated with the System Usability Scale. Hand kinematic data extracted from controller’s 3D position allowed to compute mean velocity (Vmean), peak velocity (Vpeak) and smoothness (SPARC). Results Results showed strong correlations between the number of blocks displaced with the BBT and the BBT-VR among patients with stroke for affected (r = 0.89; p  0.8; p < 0.001) and usability almost excellent (System Usability Scale = 79 ± 12.34%). On average participants moved between 30 and 40% less blocks during the BBT-VR than during the BBT. Healthy participants demonstrated significantly higher kinematic measures (Vmean = 0.22 ± 0.086 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.96 ± 0.341 ms−1; SPARC = − 3.31 ± 0.862) than patients with stroke (Vmean = 0.12 ± 0.052 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.60 ± 0.202 ms−1; SPARC = − 5.04− 7.050 to − 3.682]). Conclusion The BBT-VR is a usable, valid and reliable test to assess manual dexterity, providing kinematic parameters, in a population of patients with stroke and healthy participants.

abstract={Stroke, affecting approximately 15 million people worldwide, has long been a global cause of death and disability. Virtual Reality (VR) has shown its potential as an assistive tool for post-stroke rehabilitation. The objective of this pilot study was to define the task-specific performance metrics of VR tasks to assess the performance level of healthy subjects and patients quantitatively and to obtain their feedback for improving the developed framework. A pilot prospective study was designed. We tested the designed VR tasks on forty healthy right-handed subjects to evaluate its potential. Qualitative trajectory plots and three quantitative performance metrics—time taken to complete the task, percentage relative error, and trajectory smoothness—were computed from the recorded data of forty healthy subjects. Two patients with stroke were also enrolled to compare their performance with healthy subjects. Each participant received one VR session of 90 min. No adverse effects were noticed throughout the study. Performance metrics obtained from healthy subjects were used as a reference for patients. Relatively higher values of task completion time and trajectory smoothness and lower values of relative % error was observed for the affected hands w.r.t the unaffected hands of both the patients. For the unaffected hands of both the patients, the performance levels were found objectively closer to that of healthy subjects. A library of VR tasks for wrist and fingers were designed, and task-specific performance metrics were defined in this study. The evaluation of the VR exercises using these performance metrics will help the clinicians to assess the patient’s progress quantitatively and to design the rehabilitation framework for a future clinical study.},

abstract={Background: Cognitive deficits are present in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Assessments used to measure cognition in these disorders are time-consuming, burdensome, and have low ecological validity. To address these limitations, we developed a novel virtual reality shopping task—VStore. Objective: This study aims to establish the construct validity of VStore in relation to the established computerized cognitive battery, Cogstate, and explore its sensitivity to age-related cognitive decline. Methods: A total of 142 healthy volunteers aged 20-79 years participated in the study. The main VStore outcomes included verbal recall of 12 grocery items, time to collect items, time to select items on a self-checkout machine, time to make the payment, time to order coffee, and total completion time. Construct validity was examined through a series of backward elimination regression models to establish which Cogstate tasks, measuring attention, processing speed, verbal and visual learning, working memory, executive function, and paired associate learning, in addition to age and technological familiarity, best predicted VStore performance. In addition, 2 ridge regression and 2 logistic regression models supplemented with receiver operating characteristic curves were built, with VStore outcomes in the first model and Cogstate outcomes in the second model entered as predictors of age and age cohorts, respectively. Results: Overall VStore performance, as indexed by the total time spent completing the task, was best explained by Cogstate tasks measuring attention, working memory, paired associate learning, and age and technological familiarity, accounting for 47% of the variance. In addition, with λ=5.16, the ridge regression model selected 5 parameters for VStore when predicting age (mean squared error 185.80, SE 19.34), and with λ=9.49 for Cogstate, the model selected all 8 tasks (mean squared error 226.80, SE 23.48). Finally, VStore was found to be highly sensitive (87%) and specific (91.7%) to age cohorts, with 94.6% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that VStore is a promising assessment that engages standard cognitive domains and is sensitive to age-related cognitive decline.},

abstract={Background Mastery of technical skills is one of the fundamental goals of surgical training for novices. Meanwhile, performing laparoscopic procedures requires exceptional surgical skills compared to open surgery. However, it is often difficult for trainees to learn through observation and practice only. Virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation is expanding and rapidly advancing. A major obstacle for laparoscopic trainees is the difficulty of well-performed dissection. Therefore, we developed a new VR simulation system, Lap-PASS LP-100, which focuses on training to create proper tension on the tissue in laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy dissection. This study aimed to validate this new VR simulation system. Methods A total of 50 participants were asked to perform medial dissection of the meso-sigmoid colon on the VR simulator. Forty-four surgeons and six non-medical professionals working in the National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan, were enrolled in this study. The surgeons were: laparoscopic surgery experts with > 100 laparoscopic surgeries (LS), 21 were novices with experience < 100 LS, and five without previous experience in LS. The participants’ surgical performance was evaluated by three blinded raters using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS). Results There were significant differences (P-values < 0.044) in all GOALS items between the non-medical professionals and surgeons. The experts were significantly superior to the novices in one item of GOALS: efficiency (4(4–5) vs. 4(3–4)], with a 95% confidence interval, p = 0.042). However, both bimanual dexterity and total score in the experts were not statistically different but tended to be higher than in the novices. Conclusions Our study demonstrated a full validation of our new system. This could detect the surgeons' ability to perform surgical dissection and suggest that this VR simulator could be an effective training tool. This surgical VR simulator might have tremendous potential to enhance training for surgeons.},

abstract={Progression in digital pathology has yielded new opportunities for a remote work environment. We evaluated the utility of digital review of breast cancer immunohistochemical prognostic markers (IHC) using whole slide images (WSI) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cytology cell block specimens (CB) using three different scanners.CB from 20 patients with breast cancer diagnosis and available IHC were included. Glass slides including 20 Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), 20 Estrogen Receptor (ER), 20 Progesterone Receptor (PR), 16 Androgen Receptor (AR), and 20 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) were scanned on 3 different scanners. Four breast pathologists reviewed the WSI and recorded their semi-quantitative scoring for each marker. Kappa concordance was defined as complete agreement between glass/digital pairs. Discordances between microscopic and digital reads were classified as a major when a clinically relevant change was seen. Minor discordances were defined as differences in scoring percentages/staining pattern that would not have resulted in a clinical implication. Scanner precision was tabulated according to the success rate of each scan on all three scanners.In total, we had 228 paired glass/digital IHC reads on all 3 scanners. There was strong concordance kappa ≥0.85 for all pathologists when comparing paired microscopic/digital reads. Strong concordance (kappa ≥0.86) was also seen when comparing reads between scanners.Twenty-three percent of the WSI required rescanning due to barcode detection failures, 14% due to tissue detection failures, and 2% due to focus issues. Scanner 1 had the best average precision of 92%. HER2 IHC had the lowest intra-scanner precision (64%) among all stains.This study is the first to address the utility of WSI in breast cancer IHC in CB and to validate its reporting using 3 different scanners. Digital images are reliable for breast IHC assessment in CB and offer similar reproducibility to microscope reads.},

abstract={AimsNon-invasive measures of brain iron content would be of great benefit in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) to serve as a biomarker for disease progression and evaluation of iron chelation therapy. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides several quantitative measures of brain iron content, none of these have been validated for patients with a severely increased cerebral iron burden. We aimed to validate R2* as a quantitative measure of brain iron content in aceruloplasminemia, the most severely iron-loaded NBIA phenotype.MethodsTissue samples from 50 gray- and white matter regions of a postmortem aceruloplasminemia brain and control subject were scanned at 1.5 T to obtain R2*, and biochemically analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. For gray matter samples of the aceruloplasminemia brain, sample R2* values were compared with postmortem in situ MRI data that had been obtained from the same subject at 3 T – in situ R2*. Relationships between R2* and tissue iron concentration were determined by linear regression analyses.ResultsMedian iron concentrations throughout the whole aceruloplasminemia brain were 10 to 15 times higher than in the control subject, and R2* was linearly associated with iron concentration. For gray matter samples of the aceruloplasminemia subject with an iron concentration up to 1000 mg/kg, 91% of variation in R2* could be explained by iron, and in situ R2* at 3 T and sample R2* at 1.5 T were highly correlated. For white matter regions of the aceruloplasminemia brain, 85% of variation in R2* could be explained by iron.ConclusionsR2* is highly sensitive to variations in iron concentration in the severely iron-loaded brain, and might be used as a non-invasive measure of brain iron content in aceruloplasminemia and potentially other NBIA disorders.},

abstract={SummaryPurposeThe purpose of this study was to develop a novel mouth contactless breathing exercise solution based on virtual reality (VR), and to test its feasibility.MethodsWe developed the Virtual Reality-based Breathing Exercise System (VR-BRES), a self-regulating biofeedback breathing exercise with gaming characteristics and a soft stretch sensor. The feasibility and efficacy of the VR-BRES prototype were investigated through a randomized crossover trial. Fifty healthy adults participated in the trial, and their respiratory parameters and user evaluation of the VR-BRES were compared with conventional deep breathing (CDB) exercises.ResultsThe respiratory parameters, forced vital capacity (Z = 4.82, 4.95, p < .001), forced expiratory volume in one second (t = 6.02, 6.26, p < .001), and peak expiratory flow (t = 5.35, 5.68, p < .001) were significantly higher during breathing exercises using the VR-BRES. User evaluation was also significantly higher for the VR-BRES in terms of efficiency (Z = 3.86, p < .001), entertainingness (Z = 5.00, p < .001), and intention to use (Z = 3.22, p = .001) compared to CDB. However, there was no difference in convenience between the two methods (Z = −0.90, p = .369).ConclusionThe VR-BRES has the potential to be an efficient breathing exercise solution. We recommend a clinical study that evaluates the effects of the VR-BRES for a certain period of time for people who need breathing exercises.},

abstract={Joint applications of virtual reality (VR) systems and electroencephalography (EEG) offer numerous new possibilities ranging from behavioral science to therapy. VR systems allow for highly controlled experimental environments, while EEG offers a non-invasive window to brain activity with a millisecond-ranged temporal resolution. However, EEG measurements are highly susceptible to electromagnetic (EM) noise and the influence of EM noise of head-mounted-displays (HMDs) on EEG signal quality has not been conclusively investigated. In this paper, we propose a structured approach to test HMDs for EM noise potentially harmful to EEG measures. The approach verifies the impact of HMDs on the frequency- and time-domain of the EEG signal recorded in heathy subjects. The verification task includes a comparison of conditions with and without an HMD during (i) an eyes-open vs. eyes-closed task, and (ii) with respect to the sensory- evoked brain activity. The approach is developed and tested to derive potential effects of two commercial HMDs, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive Pro, on the quality of 64-channel EEG measurements. The results show that the HMDs consistently introduce artefacts, especially at the line hum of 50 Hz and the HMD refresh rate of 90 Hz, respectively, and their harmonics. The frequency range that is typically most important in non-invasive EEG research and applications (<50 Hz) however, remained largely unaffected. Hence, our findings demonstrate that high-quality EEG recordings, at least in the frequency range up to 50 Hz, can be obtained with the two tested HMDs. However, the number of commercially available HMDs is constantly rising. We strongly suggest to thoroughly test such devices upfront since each HMD will most likely have its own EM footprint and this article provides a structured approach to implement such tests with arbitrary devices.},

abstract={Background: Accurately measuring postural sway is an important part of balance assessment and rehabilitation. Although force plates give accurate measurements, their costs and space requirements make their use impractical in many situations. Objective: The work presented in this paper aimed to address this issue by validating a virtual reality (VR) headset as a relatively low-cost alternative to force plates for postural sway measurement. The HTC Vive (HTC Corporation) VR headset has built-in sensors that allow for position and orientation tracking, making it a potentially eﬀective tool for balance assessments. Methods: Participants in this study were asked to stand upright on a force plate (NeuroCom; Natus Medical Incorporated) while wearing the HTC Vive. Position data were collected from the headset and force plate simultaneously as participants experienced a custom-built VR environment that covered their entire field of view. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to examine the test-retest reliability of the postural control variables, which included the normalized path length, root mean square (RMS), and peak-to-peak (P2P) value. These were computed from the VR position output data and the center of pressure (COP) data from the force plate. Linear regression was used to investigate the correlations between the VR and force plate measurements. Results: Our results showed that the test-retest reliability of the RMS and P2P value of VR headset outputs (ICC: range 0.285-0.636) was similar to that of the RMS and P2P value of COP outputs (ICC: range 0.228-0.759). The linear regression between VR and COP measures showed significant correlations in RMSs and P2P values. Conclusions: Based on our results, the VR headset has the potential to be used for postural control measurements. However, the further development of software and testing protocols for balance assessments is needed.},

abstract={Background: In neuropsychology, fully immersive virtual reality (VR) has been spotlighted as a promising tool. It is considered that VR not only overcomes the existing limitation of neuropsychological tests but is also appropriate for treating executive functions (EFs) within activities of daily living (ADL) due to its high ecological validity. While fully immersive VR offers new possibilities of neuropsychological tests, there are few studies that overview the intellectual landscape and academic trends in the research related to mainly targeted EFs with fully immersive VR. Objective: The objective of this study is to get an overview of the research trends that use VR in neuropsychological tests and to analyze the research trends using fully immersive VR neuropsychological tests with experimental articles. Methods: This review was carried out according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles were searched in three web databases using keywords related to VR, EFs, and cognitive abilities. The study was conducted in two steps, keyword analysis and in-depth systematic review. In the web database search from 2000 to 2019, 1167 articles were initially collected, of which 234 articles in the eligibility phase were used to conduct keyword analysis and a total of 47 articles were included for systematic review. Results: In keyword analysis, the number of articles focused on dementia including the keywords “MCI,” “SCD,” and “dementia” were highlighted over the period, rather than other symptoms. In addition, we identified that the use of behavioral and physiological data in virtual environments (VEs) has dramatically increased in recent studies. In the systematic review, we focused on the purpose of study, assessment, treatment, and validation of usability and structure. We found that treatment studies and uncategorized studies including presence and cybersickness issues have emerged in the recent period. In addition, the target symptoms and range of participants were diversified. Conclusions: There has been a continuously increasing interest in dealing with neuropsychology by using fully immersive VR. Target cognitive abilities have been diversified, as well as target symptoms. Moreover, the concept of embodied cognition was transplanted in this research area.},

abstract={Purpose High resolution flat-panel computed tomography arthrography (FPCT-A) and magnetic resonance arthrography (MR-A) are well suited to evaluate osteochondral lesions. The current study compares the performance of FPCT-A versus MR-A in an experimental setting. Methods Fourteen cadaveric ankles were prepared with artificial osteochondral defects of various sizes in four separate talar locations. After intra-articular contrast injection, FPCT-A and 3-T MR-A were acquired. Each defect was then filled with synthetic pallets. The resulting cast was used as reference. Two independent radiologists measured the dimensions of all defects with FPCT-A and MR-A. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Data were compared using t-tests and Bland-Altman plots. Results The correlation for FPCT-A and cast was higher compared to MR-A and cast (ICC 0.876 vs. 0.799 for surface length x width]; ICC 0.887 vs. 0.866 for depth, p0.05). Depth measurements were significantly smaller by MR-A (mean difference -1.1 mm, p<0.001). There was no bias between the different modalities. Conclusions Ex vivo FPCT-A and MR-A both deliver high diagnostic accuracy for the evaluation of osteochondral defects. FPCT-A was slightly more accurate than MR-A, which was most significant when measuring lesion depth.},

abstract={Introduction The aim was to validate the dosimetric and geometric accuracy of radiotherapy treatment plans for prostate cancer based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging only and a solution based on computed tomography (CT) supported by MR imaging. Material and methods We used CT and MR images of ten prostate cancer patients implanted with three fiducial markers (FM) in the prostate gland. Rigid registration based on FM was performed to assess the fusion accuracy between MR and CT images. The differences between prostate contours (clinical target volume – CTV) on CT (CTVCT) and MR (CTVMR) images were scored using the Dice similarity coefficient and directly comparing the outlined volumes. The volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were designed and optimised on synthetic CT (sCT) to obtain the dose distribution for the MR-only solution. In the next step, the sCT images were replaced by conventional CT images and the plans were recalculated. The doses obtained on sCT and CT were compared by direct dose subtraction and the gamma method. Results The averaged fiducial registration error was equal to 0.5 mm. All CTVCT volumes were significantly bigger than corresponding CTV delineated on MR images (p = 0.005). The direct dose comparison shows that for 97.1% of patients’ bodies, the differences were smaller than 0.1%. The average gamma passing rates were higher than 0.970. Conclusions MR imaging allows for a more precise delineation of the prostate compared to CT imaging. The workflow of plan preparation based on MR and CT is burdened with an FM registration error that is eliminated by an MR-only solution with no compromise on dose distribution.},

abstract={PurposeTo determine whether childhood intermittent exotropia (IXT) affects distance divergence and performance in block-building tasks within a virtual reality (VR) environment.MethodsThirty-nine children with IXT, aged 6–12 years, who underwent muscle surgery and 37 normal controls were enrolled. Children were instructed to watch the target moving away and perform a block-building task while fitted with a VR head-mounted display equipped with eye- and hand-movement tracking systems. The change in inter-ocular distance with binocular distance viewing, time to stack five cube blocks of different sizes in order, and distance disparities between the largest and farthest cubes were assessed. All children were evaluated at baseline and 3-month time points.ResultsThe patients with IXT exhibited a larger distance divergence than did controls (p = 0.024), which was associated with greater distance angle of deviation and poorer distance control (r = 0.350, p = 0.001 and r = 0.349, p = 0.004). At baseline, the patients with IXT showed larger distance disparities in the block-building task than did controls in terms of the horizontal, vertical, and 3-dimensional (3-D) measurements (all ps < 0.050). Larger horizontal disparity was associated with greater distance angle of deviation (r = 0.383, p = 0.037). Three months after surgery, the horizontal and 3-D disparities in the patients with IXT improved significantly and were not comparably different compared with controls.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that VR-based block-building task may be useful in testing possible deficits in visuo-motor skills associated with childhood IXT.},

abstract={This paper proposes an augmented reality interactive method based on improved Kinect sensor commands to eliminate the tracking error of moving targets. Designed posture tracking architecture. Experiments show that the above two types of algorithms can meet the needs of the project and have certain light resistance. Among them, the algorithm based on feature points has certain advantages in speed and requires fewer manual processing steps. In this case, it is necessary to combine the previous algorithm to solve the posture, use the optical flow method to track the feature points, avoid the operation of extracting, matching, and removing the mismatch of each frame of feature points, and improve the speed of the algorithm.},

abstract={PurposeTo validate an MR‐compatible version of the ScandiDos Delta4 Phantom+ on a 0.35T MR guided linear accelerator (MR‐Linac) system and to determine the effect of plan complexity on the measurement results.Methods/Materials36 clinical treatment plans originally delivered on a 0.35T MR linac system were re‐planned on the Delta4 Phantom+ MR geometry following our clinical quality assurance (QA) protocol. The QA plans were then measured using the Delta4 Phantom+ MR and the global gamma pass rates were compared to previous results measured using a Sun Nuclear ArcCHECK‐MR. Both 3%/3mm and 2%/2mm global gamma pass rates with a 20% dose threshold were recorded and compared. Plan complexity was quantified for each clinical plan investigated using 24 different plan metrics and each metric’s correlation with the overall 2%/2mm global gamma pass rate was investigated using Pearson correlation coefficients.ResultsBoth systems demonstrated comparable levels of gamma pass rates at both the 3%/3mm and 2%/2mm level for all plan complexity metrics. Nine plan metrics including area, number of active MLCs, perimeter, edge metric, leaf segment variability, complete irradiation area outline, irregularity, leaf travel index, and unique opening index were moderately (|r| > 0.5) correlated with the Delta4 2%/2mm global gamma pass rates whereas those same metrics had weak correlation with the ArcCHECK‐MR pass rates. Only the perimeter to area ratio and small aperture score (20 mm) metrics showed moderate correlation with the ArcCHECK‐MR gamma pass rates.ConclusionsThe MR‐compatible version of the ScandiDos Delta4 Phantom+ MR has been validated for clinical use on a 0.35T MR‐Linac with results being comparable to an ArcCHECK‐MR system in use clinically for almost five years. Most plan complexity metrics did not correlate with lower 2%/2mm gamma pass rates using the ArcCHECK‐MR but several metrics were found to be moderately correlated with lower 2%/2mm global gamma pass rates for the Delta4 Phantom+ MR.},

abstract={This study verifies the effects of learning experiences by measuring the degrees of awareness of direct experience felt by users detecting both temperature and wind occurring within a virtual space as real cutaneous sensations. Learning while using virtual reality (VR)—with a focus on audiovisual vividness, tactile interactivity, and locomotive interactivity—was thus compared to VR utilization learning with the aforementioned wind and temperature sensations. The results show a much higher level of vividness and presence for those that experienced VR learning with cutaneous sensations. This confirms that a user feels an experience more vividly, and therefore as being closer to real life, when his or her senses are engaged, particularly through the use of skin sensations. Furthermore, when asked to describe their experiences, most of the group studied (95.8%) selected the “Exploratory Stage” (allowing users to believe they can feel, touch, and manipulate objects) and the “Spectator Stage” (looking at an object as if it were there). The results demonstrate a difference from previous VR learning that provides no cutaneous sensations and concludes that experiential learning can therefore be enhanced.},

abstract={Most surgical simulators leverage virtual or bench models to simulate reality. This study proposes and validates a method for workspace configuration of a surgical simulator which utilizes a haptic device for interaction with a virtual model and a bench model to provide additional tactile feedback based on planned surgical manoeuvers. Numerical analyses were completed to determine the workspace and position of a haptic device, relative to the bench model, used in the surgical simulator, and the determined configuration was validated using device limitations and user data from surgical and nonsurgical users. For the validation, surgeons performed an identical surgery on a cadaver prior to using the simulator, and their trajectories were then compared to the determined workspace for the haptic device. The configuration of the simulator was determined appropriate through workspace analysis and the collected user trajectories. Statistical analyses suggest differences in trajectories between the participating surgeons which were not affected by the imposed haptic workspace. This study, therefore, demonstrates a method to optimally position a haptic device with respect to a bench model while meeting the manoeuverability needs of a surgical procedure. The validation method identified workspace position and user trajectory towards ideal configuration of a mixed reality simulator.},

abstract={Aiming at the problem of low diagnosis efficiency and accuracy, due to noise and cross aliasing among various faults when diagnosing composite faults of rolling bearing under actual working conditions, a composite fault diagnosis method of rolling bearing based on optimized wavelet packet autoregressive (AR) spectral energy entropy and adaptive no velocity term particle swarm optimization-self organizing map-back propagation neural network (ANVTPSO-SOM-BPNN) is proposed. The energy entropy feature is extracted from the bearing vibration signal through wavelet packet AR spectrum, and SOM and BPNN are combined to form a series network. For PSO, the velocity term is discarded and the inertia weight and learning factor are adaptively adjusted. Finally, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence fusion diagnosis is carried out. To get closer to the application condition, the data are collected near and far away from the fault point for the composite fault diagnosis, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Simple SummaryHyperthermia treatments where tumor tissue is heated to 40–44 °C for 60–90 min can be hampered by a lack of accurate temperature monitoring. To solve this need, we have designed an MR compatible head and neck hyperthermia applicator: the MRcollar. In this work, we experimentally validated the design, heating capabilities and the MR compatibility of the MRcollar. The MRcollar antennas efficiently transfer the power and have low interaction between the antenna elements. The heating and focusing capabilities satisfy the requirements. The MRcollar can operate in an MR scanner and it can acquire higher quality MR images due to the built in receiver elements. The MRcollar has great potential to improve hyperthermia treatment in the head and neck region and it is now ready for in vivo studies.AbstractClinical effectiveness of hyperthermia treatments, in which tumor tissue is artificially heated to 40–44 °C for 60–90 min, can be hampered by a lack of accurate temperature monitoring. The need for noninvasive temperature monitoring in the head and neck region (H&N) and the potential of MR thermometry prompt us to design an MR compatible hyperthermia applicator: the MRcollar. In this work, we validate the design, numerical model, and MR performance of the MRcollar. The MRcollar antennas have low reflection coefficients (<−15 dB) and the intended low interaction between the individual antenna modules (<−32 dB). A 10 °C increase in 3 min was reached in a muscle-equivalent phantom, such that the specifications from the European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology were easily reached. The MRcollar had a minimal effect on MR image quality and a five-fold improvement in SNR was achieved using the integrated coils of the MRcollar, compared to the body coil. The feasibility of using the MRcollar in an MR environment was shown by a synchronous heating experiment. The match between the predicted SAR and measured SAR using MR thermometry satisfied the gamma criteria distance-to-agreement = 5 mm, dose-difference = 7%]. All experiments combined show that the MRcollar delivers on the needs for MR—hyperthermia in the H&N and is ready for in vivo investigation.},

We cover both on-site testing, including disinfecting and other safety protocols, as well as remote and hybrid setups where both remote and on-site participants were involved. Subject matter experts from eight countries were involved in a total of 22 tests. (3) We share insights for VR user test arrangements relevant to the pandemic, remote and hybrid setups, and an industrial context, among others.

abstract={Animals make decisions under the principle of reward value maximization and surprise minimization. It is still unclear how these principles are represented in the brain and are reflected in behavior. We addressed this question using a closed-loop virtual reality system to train adult zebrafish for active avoidance. Analysis of the neural activity of the dorsal pallium during training revealed neural ensembles assigning rules to the colors of the surrounding walls. Additionally, one third of fish generated another ensemble that becomes activated only when the real perceived scenery shows discrepancy from the predicted favorable scenery. The fish with the latter ensemble escape more efficiently than the fish with the former ensembles alone, even though both fish have successfully learned to escape, consistent with the hypothesis that the latter ensemble guides zebrafish to take action to minimize this prediction error. Our results suggest that zebrafish can use both principles of goal-directed behavior, but with different behavioral consequences depending on the repertoire of the adopted principles.Using a closed-loop virtual reality system for fish, the authors show that zebrafish are capable of assigning rules to the scenery they see, and of generating a state prediction error by comparing reality with a prediction derived from an internal model.},

abstract={The three types of presentations of ADHD often co-occur with other disorders, anxiety being one of the most prevalent. For this reason and because there are few studies that have examined the influence of anxiety on attentional activities, this study aims to determine how internalizing difficulties (anxiety levels) can influence performance in a virtual reality continuous performance test. The study used a non-probabilistic clinical sample comprising 68 boys (66%) and 35 girls (34%) aged between 6 and 16 (M = 12.24; SD = 2.45) who had been referred to clinical services for the evaluation of ADHD symptoms. Once informed consent was given, the children were administered the STAI-C scale and a virtual reality continuous performance test by expert researchers. Hierarchical regression models showed that only state anxiety demonstrated significant explanatory power over attentional variables. These findings confirm how important it is for children to feel relaxed when they undergo psychological evaluation tests, as otherwise the individual’s intervention design would be based on biased data. Similarly, the findings also suggested an effect of IQ in the interpretation of continuous performance scores.},

abstract={Simple SummaryIn soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients, the decision for the optimal treatment modality largely depends on STS size, location, and a pathological measure that assesses tumor aggressiveness called “tumor grading”. To determine tumor grading, invasive biopsies are needed before therapy. In previous research studies, quantitative imaging features (“radiomics”) have been associated with tumor grading. In this work, we assessed the possibility of predicting tumor grading using an artificial intelligence technique called “deep learning” or “convolutional neural networks”. By analyzing either T1-weighted or T2-weighted MRI sequences, non-invasive tumor grading prediction was possible in an independent test patient cohort. The results were comparable to previous research work obtained with radiomics; however, the reproducibility of the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence was improved. The T2-based model was also able to significantly identify patients with a high risk for death after therapy.AbstractBackground: In patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, tumor grading constitutes a decisive factor to determine the best treatment decision. Tumor grading is obtained by pathological work-up after focal biopsies. Deep learning (DL)-based imaging analysis may pose an alternative way to characterize STS tissue. In this work, we sought to non-invasively differentiate tumor grading into low-grade (G1) and high-grade (G2/G3) STS using DL techniques based on MR-imaging. Methods: Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted fat-saturated (T1FSGd) MRI sequences and fat-saturated T2-weighted (T2FS) sequences were collected from two independent retrospective cohorts (training: 148 patients, testing: 158 patients). Tumor grading was determined following the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group in pre-therapeutic biopsies. DL models were developed using transfer learning based on the DenseNet 161 architecture. Results: The T1FSGd and T2FS-based DL models achieved area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.75 and 0.76 on the test cohort, respectively. T1FSGd achieved the best F1-score of all models (0.90). The T2FS-based DL model was able to significantly risk-stratify for overall survival. Attention maps revealed relevant features within the tumor volume and in border regions. Conclusions: MRI-based DL models are capable of predicting tumor grading with good reproducibility in external validation.},

abstract={Background: Although various technologies are used to evaluate driving skill, there are some limitations such as the limited range of the monitor and the possible risk of causing cybersickness. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in the hazard perception and cybersickness experienced between novice and experienced drivers measured in a VR hazard perception test with a head-mounted display (HMD). Methods: The novice (n = 32) and the experienced drivers (n = 36) participated in the hazard perception test through the VR of an HMD. Results: The total number of identified hazards was 1071 in the novice drivers and 1376 in the experienced drivers. Two of the hazards appeared to be only identifiable through the HMD. A chi-square test revealed that experienced drivers were more likely to identify the hazards than the novice drivers (p 0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the VR hazard perception test may be useful for evaluating patients’ driving skills.},

abstract={Background Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a condition characterized by chronic subjective dizziness and exacerbated by visual stimuli or upright movement. Typical balance tests do not replicate the environments known to increase symptoms in people with PPPD—crowded places with moving objects. Using a virtual reality system, we quantified dynamic balance in people with PPPD and healthy controls in diverse visual conditions. Methods Twenty-two individuals with PPPD and 29 controls performed a square-shaped fast walking task (Four-Square Step Test Virtual Reality—FSST-VR) using a head-mounted-display (HTC Vive) under 3 visual conditions (empty train platform; people moving; people and trains moving). Head kinematics was used to measure task duration, movement smoothness and anterior–posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) ranges of movement (ROM). Heart rate (HR) was monitored using a chest-band. Participants also completed a functional mobility test (Timed-Up-and-Go; TUG) and questionnaires measuring anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI), balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence; ABC), perceived disability (Dizziness Handicap Inventory) and simulator sickness (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire). Main effects of visual load and group and associations between performance, functional and self-reported outcomes were examined. Results State anxiety and simulator sickness did not increase following testing. AP-ROM and HR increased with high visual load in both groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in head kinematics. In the high visual load conditions, high trait anxiety and longer TUG duration were moderately associated with reduced AP and ML-ROM in the PPPD group and low ABC and high perceived disability were associated with reduced AP-ROM (|r| =  0.47 to 0.53; p < 0.05). In contrast, in controls high STAI-trait, low ABC and longer TUG duration were associated with increased AP-ROM (|r| = 0.38 to 0.46; p < 0.05) and longer TUG duration was associated with increased ML-ROM (r = 0.53, p < 0.01). Conclusions FSST-VR may shed light on movement strategies in PPPD beyond task duration. While no main effect of group was observed, the distinct associations with self-reported and functional outcomes, identified using spatial head kinematics, suggest that some people with PPPD reduce head degrees of freedom when performing a dynamic balance task. This supports a potential link between spatial perception and PPPD symptomatology.},

abstract={The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of a tactile attention distraction from pain and compare its effectiveness with a virtual reality (VR) distraction on an analogous task. VR is considered to be the gold standard for attention distraction, but it cannot be used in certain clinical cases or for particular medical procedures. A repeatedmeasures experimental study was carried out with 42 participants using tactile and VR variants of an n-back task and a cold pressor test for pain. The independent variable was the distraction type (tactile, VR, or no-distraction) and the dependent variable was pain tolerance (i.e., time participants kept their hand in cold water). The results showed that both tactile and VR games effectively increased pain tolerance compared to the control condition. Effect sizes for both interventions were similar. However, the effect was observed only for female participants.},

abstract={Background: The Equitest system (Neurocom) is a computerized dynamic posturography device used by health care providers and clinical researchers to safely test an individual’s postural control. While the Equitest system has evaluative and rehabilitative value, it may be limited owing to its cost, lack of portability, and reliance on only sagittal plane movements. Virtual reality (VR) provides an opportunity to reduce these limitations by providing more mobile and cost-effective tools while also observing a wider array of postural characteristics. Objective: This study aimed to test the plausibility of using VR as a feasible alternative to the Equitest system for conducting a sensory organization test. Methods: A convenience sample of 20 college-aged healthy individuals participated in the study. Participants completed the sensory organization test using the Equitest system as well as using a VR environment while standing atop a force plate (Bertec Inc). The Equitest system measures the equilibrium index. During VR trials, the estimated equilibrium index, 95% ellipse area, path length, and anterior-posterior detrended fluctuation analysis scaling exponent alpha were calculated from center of pressure data. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between the equilibrium index and center of pressure–derived balance measures. Intraclass correlations for absolute agreement and consistency were calculated to compare the equilibrium index and estimated equilibrium index. Results: Intraclass correlations demonstrated moderate consistency and absolute agreement (0.5 < intraclass correlation coefficient < 0.75) between the equilibrium index and estimated equilibrium index from the Equitest and VR sensory organization test (SOT), respectively, in four of six tested conditions. Additionally, weak to moderate correlations between force plate measurements and the equilibrium index were noted in several of the conditions. Conclusions: This research demonstrated the plausibility of using VR as an alternative method to conduct the SOT. Ongoing development and testing of virtual environments are necessary before employing the technology as a replacement to current clinical tests.},

abstract={The development of light and very thin concrete building structures and demand for extremely thin elements in design are inter alia reasons for the development of composite materials as non-traditional reinforcement. Composite materials are currently used as reinforcement mostly in the form of fiber reinforced polymer bars similar to traditional steel reinforcement bars, but the last decade sees also rise in the use of technical textiles. This article is focused on the interaction between impregnated textile reinforcement and high-performance concrete matrix and its easy determination using originally modified pullout test. The second aim of this article is improvement of interaction conditions between reinforcement and cementitious matrix using fine-grained silica sand applied on the surface of the composite reinforcement similarly to the traditional fiber reinforced polymer reinforcement with commonly used diameters. To investigate an effect of this modification a bending test was performed on small thin concrete slabs with different amounts of reinforcement.},

abstract={Breathing exercises with biofeedback have benefits over breathing exercises without biofeedback. However, the traditional measurement of respiratory signals that is required as part of feeding back the breath incurs high cost and effort. We propose a novel virtual reality (VR) based approach to respiratory biofeedback that utilizes the positionally tracked hand controllers integrated into modern VR systems to capture and feedback the respiration-induced abdominal movements. In a randomized controlled laboratory study, we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of the developed biofeedback algorithm. In total, 72 participants performed a short breathing exercise in VR with or without respiratory biofeedback. The feedback integration resulted in a satisfactory user experience, a heightened breath awareness, a greater focus on slow diaphragmatic breathing and an increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This evidences that the novel biofeedback approach is low-cost, unobtrusive, usable and effective in increasing breath awareness and promoting slow diaphragmatic breathing in the context of VR-based breathing exercises. Future studies need to investigate the broader applicability and long-term effects.},

abstract={Previous research indicates that the size of the own body affects the judgment of objects’ size, depending on the amount of subjective ownership toward the body (Van der Hoort et al. in PLOS ONE 6(5):e20195, 2011). We are the first to transfer this own-body-size effect into a virtual environment. In a series of three experiments, participants (N = 68) had to embody small, medium, and large avatars and judge the size of objects. Body ownership was manipulated using synchronous and asynchronous touch. We also included a new paradigm with an additional change of perspective to induce stronger ownership (Experiment 2). Additionally, we assessed whether the visibility of the body during the judgment phase influenced the results (Experiment 3). In all three experiments, we found an overestimation in a small and an underestimation in a large body compared to a medium body. However, size estimation did not depend on the degree of ownership despite clear differences in self-reported ownership. Our results show that a virtual reality scenario does not require a visuotactile manipulation of ownership in order to evoke the own-body-size effect. Our validation of the effect in a virtual setting may be helpful for the design of clinical applications.},

abstract={Background: Digital rectal examination is a difficult examination to learn and teach because of limited opportunities for practice; however, the main challenge is that students and tutors cannot see the finger when it is palpating the anal canal and prostate gland inside the patients. Objective: This paper presents an augmented reality system to be used with benchtop models commonly available in medical schools with the aim of addressing the problem of lack of visualization. The system enables visualization of the examining finger, as well as of the internal organs when performing digital rectal examinations. Magnetic tracking sensors are used to track the movement of the finger, and a pressure sensor is used to monitor the applied pressure. By overlaying a virtual finger on the real finger and a virtual model on the benchtop model, students can see through the examination and finger maneuvers. Methods: The system was implemented in the Unity game engine (Unity Technologies) and uses a first-generation HoloLens (Microsoft Inc) as an augmented reality device. To evaluate the system, 19 participants (9 clinicians who routinely performed digital rectal examinations and 10 medical students) were asked to use the system and answer 12 questions regarding the usefulness of the system. Results: The system showed the movement of an examining finger in real time with a frame rate of 60 fps on the HoloLens and accurately aligned the virtual and real models with a mean error of 3.9 mm. Users found the movement of the finger was realistic (mean 3.9, SD 1.2); moreover, they found the visualization of the finger and internal organs were useful for teaching, learning, and assessment of digital rectal examinations (finger: mean 4.1, SD 1.1; organs: mean 4.6, SD 0.8), mainly targeting a novice group. Conclusions: The proposed augmented reality system was designed to improve teaching and learning of digital rectal examination skills by providing visualization of the finger and internal organs. The initial user study proved its applicability and usefulness.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was (1) to implement a test for binocular imbalance in a Virtual Reality headset, (2) to assess its testability, reliability and outcomes in a population of clinical patients and (3) to evaluate the relationships of interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and binocular imbalance to amblyogenic risk factors. 100 volunteers (6 to 70 years old, mean 21.2 ± 16.2), 21 with no amblyogenic risk factors and 79 with amblyopia or a history of amblyopia participated. Participants were classified by amblyogenic risk factor (24 anisometropic, 25 strabismic and 30 mixed) and, for those with strabismus, also by refractive response (16 accommodative and 39 non-accommodative). We characterized our sample using three variables, called the ‘triplet’ henceforth: interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and imbalance factor. Binocular imbalance showed high test-retest reliability (no significant difference between test and retest in a subgroup, n = 20, p = 0.831); was correlated with Worth 4 dots test (r = 0.538, p<0.0001); and correlated with both interocular acuity difference (r = 0.575, p<0.0001) and stereoacuity (r = 0.675, p<0.0001). The mean values of each variable of the triplet differed depending on group classification. Mixed and non-accommodative groups showed the worst mean values compared with the other groups. Among participants with strabismus, strabismic vs mixed subgroups did not show significant differences in any variable of the triplet, whereas the accommodative vs non-accommodative subgroups showed significant differences in all of them. According to a univariate logistic model, any variable of the triplet provides a good metric for differentiating patients from controls, except for binocular imbalance for anisometropic subgroup. The proposed binocular imbalance test is feasible and reliable. We recommend monitoring amblyopia clinically not only considering visual acuity, but also stereoacuity and interocular imbalance. Stereoacuity on its own fails because of the high percentage of patients with no measurable stereoacuity. Binocular imbalance may help to fill that gap.},

abstract={Today, falls constitute a substantial health problem, especially in the elderly, and the diagnostic tests used by clinicians present often a low sensitivity and specificity. This is the case for the Timed Up and Go test which lacks contextualization with regard to everyday life limiting the relevance of its diagnosis. Virtual reality enables the creation of immersive, reproducible and secure environments, close to situations encountered in daily life, and as such could improve falling risk assessment. This study aims to evaluate the effect of immersive virtual reality by wearing a virtual reality headset with a non-disturbing virtual environment compared to real world on the Timed Up and Go test completion. Thirty-one elders (73.7 ± 9 years old) volunteered to participate in the study and the mean times and number of steps to complete a Timed Up and Go were compared in two conditions: actual-world clinical and virtual reality conditions. The results showed that the mean completion times and most of the mean number of steps of the Timed Up and Go in virtual reality condition were significantly different to those in clinical condition. These results suggest that there is a virtual reality effect and this effect is significantly correlated to the time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go. This information will be of interest to quantify the potential part of virtual reality effect on the motor control, measured in a virtual task using virtual controlled disturbances.},

abstract={As the global population ages, the incidence of major neurocognitive disorders (major NCDs), such as the most common geriatric major NCD, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has grown. Thus, the need for more definitive cognitive assessment or even effective non-pharmacological intervention for age-related NCDs is becoming more and more pressing given that no definitive diagnostics or efficacious therapeutics are currently unavailable for them. We evaluate the current state of the art of cognitive assessment for major NCDs, and then briefly glance ahead at potential application of virtual reality (VR) technologies in major NCD assessment and in cognition training of visuospatial reasoning in a 3D environment, as well as in the alleviation of depression and other symptoms of cognitive disorders. We believe that VR-based technologies have tremendous potentials in cognitive assessment and non-pharmacological therapy for major NCDs.},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study is to assess whether distraction (lack of attentional focus) and attention (cognitive load) are differentially involved in the analgesic effect of virtual reality (VR) immersions during a cold pressor test (CPT). Methods: Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions (high and low cognitive load, attention with or without a reminder of the pain stimuli) and performed three CPTs. Pain was assessed based on the duration of the CPT (pain tolerance), a visual analog rating scale of perceived pain intensity during the CPT and the subjective pain scale of the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Results: The statistical analyses revealed that VR immersions were associated with less pain compared to the baseline (all p < 0.001), but for the experimental manipulations, only the conditions where there was an increase in cognitive load (ie, from low cognitive load at Immersion 1 to high cognitive load at Immersion 2) were effective for increasing pain tolerance (significant Time X Conditions interaction). The interactions were not significant for pain intensity assessed with the VAS or the SF-MPQ. Conclusion: The results suggest that increases in cognitive load play an important role in the analgesic effect of VR immersion, although the combination of attentional focus and cognitive load may be important. Suggestions are given for designing a replication study.},

abstract={Discordant biotite 40Ar/39Ar age spectra are commonly reported in the literature. These can be caused by a number of processes related to in vacuo heating, homogenization of the argon distribution, and production of misleadingly flat age spectra. Problematic samples are typically derived from metamorphic belts; thermal overprinting and chloritization are two of the main known causes of disturbed age spectra. Biotite and muscovite of the Waziyü detachment fault, Yiwulüshan metamorphic core complex, Jinzhou, China, yield highly variable 40Ar/39Ar data that hinder reconstruction of their deformation history. We combined mineralogical studies with detailed 40Ar/39Ar dating of biotite, phengitic white mica, and K-feldspar augen from this fault. We infer that argon within the biotite was modified by hydrothermal fluids during fault activity and associated epidotization, chloritization, and muscovitization such that bulk sample step-heating, single grain total fusion, and in situ laser ablation of biotite produced mixed 40Ar/39Ar ages. However, detailed step-heating of biotite shows that this mineral records the ages of cooling and later alteration based on data from a coexisting rigid feldspar porphyroblast and neo-crystallized phengite that record two periods of fault activity at ~120–113 and 18–12 Ma. Our data reveal that the discordant biotite 40Ar/39Ar age spectra might represent a mixed age and that only detailed step-heating methods can extract meaningful geological details of the deformation history of a fault. Therefore, the mineral and the method must be carefully considered if metamorphic or deformed samples are dated.},

abstract={Microwave remote sensing is the most promising tool for monitoring near-surface soil moisture distributions globally. With the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions in orbit, considerable efforts are being made to evaluate derived soil moisture products via ground observations, microwave transfer simulation, and independent remote sensing retrievals. Due to the large footprint of the satellite radiometers of about 40 km in diameter and the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture, minimum sampling densities for soil moisture are required to challenge the targeted precision. Here we use 400 m resolution simulations with the regional Terrestrial System Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) and its coupling with the Community Microwave Emission Modelling platform (CMEM) to quantify the maximum sampling distance allowed for soil moisture and brightness temperature validation. Our analysis suggests that an overall sampling distance of finer than 6 km is required to validate the targeted accuracy of 0.04 cm3 cm-3 with a 70 % confidence level in SMOS and SMAP estimates over typical mid-latitude European regions. The maximum allowed sampling distance depends on the land-surface heterogeneity and the meteorological situation, which influences the soil moisture patterns, and ranges from about 6 to 17 km for a 70 % confidence level for a typical year. At the maximum allowed sampling distance on a 70 % confidence level, the accuracy of footprint-averaged soil moisture is equal to or better than brightness temperature estimates over the same area. Estimates strongly deteriorate with larger sampling distances. For the evaluation of the smaller footprints of the active and active–passive products of SMAP the required sampling densities increase; e.g., when a grid resolution of 3 km diameter is sampled by three sites of footprints of 9 km sampled by five sites required, only 50 %–60 % of the pixels have a sampling error below the nominal values. The required minimum sampling densities for ground-based radiometer networks to estimate footprint-averaged brightness temperature are higher than for soil moisture due to the non-linearities of radiative transfer, and only weakly correlated in space and time. This study provides a basis for a better understanding of the sometimes strong mismatches between derived satellite soil moisture products and ground-based measurements.},

abstract={In recent decades, gaming technology has been accepted as a feasible method for complementing traditional clinical practice, especially in neurorehabilitation; however, the viability of using 3D Virtual Reality (VR) for the assessment of upper limb motor function has not been fully explored. For that purpose, we developed a VR-based version of the Box and Blocks Test (BBT), a clinical test for the assessment of manual dexterity, as an automated alternative to the classical procedure. Our VR-based BBT (VR-BBT) integrates the traditional BBT mechanics into gameplay using the Leap Motion Controller (LMC) to capture the user’s hand motion and the Oculus Rift headset to provide a fully immersive experience. This paper focuses on evaluating the validity of our VR-BBT to reliably measure the manual dexterity in a sample of patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). For this study, a group of twenty individuals in a mild to moderate stage of PD were recruited. Participants were asked to perform the physical BBT (once) and our proposed VR-BBT (twice) system, separately. Correlation analysis of collected data was carried out. Statistical analysis proved that the performance data collected by the VR-BBT significantly correlated with the conventional assessment of the BBT. The VR-BBT scores have shown a significant association with PD severity measured by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. This fact suggests that the VR-BBT could be used as a reliable indicator for health improvements in patients with PD. Finally, the VR-BBT system presented high usability and acceptability rated by clinicians and patients.},

abstract={The present endeavor investigates the controlled surface modifications and evolution of self-assembled nano-dimensional defects on oblique Ar+ sputtered Si(111) surfaces which are important substrates for surface reconstruction. The defect formation started at off-normal incidences of 50° and then deflates into defined defect zones with decrease in oblique incidence, depending strongly on angle of ion incidence. Interestingly, it is observed that mean size & height decreases while average density of these defects increases with decreasing oblique incidence. Non-linear response of roughness of irradiated Si(111) with respect to oblique incidence is observed. Crystalline (c-Si) to amorphous (a-Si) phase transition under oblique argon ion irradiation has been revealed by Raman spectroscopy. Our analysis, thus, shows that high dose argon ion irradiation generates of self-assembled nano-scale defects and surface vacancies & their possible clustering into extended defect zones. Explicitly, ion beam-stimulated mass transport inside the amorphous layers governs the observed defect evolution. This investigation of crystalline (c-Si) coupled with amorphous (a-Si) phases of nano-structured surfaces provides insight into the potential applications in the nano-electronic and optoelectronic devices thus, initiating a new era for fabricating multitude of novel structures.},

The finite element modelling was employed to investigate the capability of the MR semi-active damper prototype design in altered the damping utilizing unique rheological properties of MR fluid. The quarter car test rig completes with DYTRAN accelerometer and LMS Scadas mobile was operated to measure the RMS sprung mass acceleration of the MR semi-active damper prototype caused by a 5cm sinusoidal bump at speed of 10km/h. The finite element modelling gave the best representation of the ability of the design to manifest the shear stress development of MR fluid used. Indeed, the MR semi-active damper model prototype was able to enhance ride comfort by decreasing the acceleration of sprang mass compare to OEM passive damper. It was found that the applied current had the greatest influence on RMS sprang mass acceleration when measured over a range of frequency.},

abstract={Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) systems allow delivering high doses of radiation to a tumour with great precision and accuracy. In this work, we use patient-specific head MR-based gel dosimeters as an end-to-end test to commission IGRT delivery systems, for stereotactic cranial radiotherapy, and investigate possible sources of errors associated with practical aspects of the measurements. A CT scan of a patient is used to 3D print the shape of the cranial bones to create head phantoms with MR-based gel inside. Each phantom was used as a patient, following the radiotherapy workflow which includes: taking a CT scan of the phantom, calculating the dose distribution using a treatment planning system (TPS) and delivering the radiation calculated by the TPS (to target three different lesions: Big, Medium and Small). Each phantom was then scanned on an MR scanner to obtain a T2 map (linear with dose), which was then rigidly registered with the CT scan of the phantom based on the phantom structures. Good agreement was obtained between the normalized R2 (=1/T2) values and TPS simulations. The relationship between R2 values and dose was investigated based on 3D regions including each lesion. Good linearity was found, but different R2-dose values relationship was obtained depending on the selected regions. The impact of applying a registration based on each lesion (and not the phantom structures) was also tested. Results show that the registration has an impact on the relationship between R2 values and dose, and although absolute dose measurements are still not possible with these MR-based gel dosimeters, they provide very detailed geometrical 3D information to validate IGRT radiotherapy treatments with high level of accuracy.},

abstract={PurposeThe magnetic field can cause a nonnegligible dosimetric effect in an MR‐Linac system. This effect should be accurately accounted for by the beam models in treatment planning systems (TPS). The purpose of the study was to verify the beam model and the entire treatment planning and delivery process for a 1.5 T MR‐Linac based on comprehensive dosimetric measurements and end‐to‐end tests.Material and methodsDosimetry measurements and end‐to‐end tests were performed on a preclinical MR‐Linac (Elekta AB) using a multitude of detectors and were compared to the corresponding beam model calculations from the TPS for the MR‐Linac. Measurement devices included ion chambers (IC), diamond detector, radiochromic film, and MR‐compatible ion chamber array and diode array. The dose in inhomogeneous phantom was also verified. The end‐to‐end tests include the generation, delivery, and comparison of 3D and IMRT plan with measurement.ResultsFor the depth dose measurements with Farmer IC, micro IC and diamond detector, the absolute difference between most measurement points and beam model calculation beyond the buildup region were <1%, at most 2% for a few measurement points. For the beam profile measurements, the absolute differences were no more than 1% outside the penumbra region and no more than 2.5% inside the penumbra region. Results of end‐to‐end tests demonstrated that three 3D static plans with single 5 × 10 cm2 fields (at gantry angle 0°, 90° and 270°) and two IMRT plans successfully passed gamma analysis with clinical criteria. The dose difference in the inhomogeneous phantom between the calculation and measurement was within 1.0%.ConclusionsBoth relative and absolute dosimetry measurements agreed well with the TPS calculation, indicating that the beam model for MR‐Linac properly accounts for the magnetic field effect. The end‐to‐end tests verified the entire treatment planning process.},

abstract={PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess test–retest reliability, agreement, and responsiveness of questionnaires on productivity loss (iPCQ-VR) and healthcare utilization (TiCP-VR) for sick-listed workers with chronic musculoskeletal pain who were referred to vocational rehabilitation. Methods Test–retest reliability and agreement was assessed with a 2-week interval. Responsiveness was assessed at discharge after a 15-week vocational rehabilitation (VR) program. Data was obtained from six Dutch VR centers. Test–retest reliability was determined with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen’s kappa. Agreement was determined by Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), smallest detectable changes (on group and individual level), and percentage observed, positive and negative agreement. Responsiveness was determined with area under the curve (AUC) obtained from receiver operation characteristic (ROC). Results A sample of 52 participants on test–retest reliability and agreement, and a sample of 223 on responsiveness were included in the analysis. Productivity loss (iPCQ-VR): ICCs ranged from 0.52 to 0.90, kappa ranged from 0.42 to 0.96, and AUC ranged from 0.55 to 0.86. Healthcare utilization (TiCP-VR): ICC was 0.81, and kappa values of the single healthcare utilization items ranged from 0.11 to 1.00. Conclusions The iPCQ-VR showed good measurement properties on working status, number of hours working per week and long-term sick leave, and low measurement properties on short-term sick leave and presenteeism. The TiCP-VR showed adequate reliability on all healthcare utilization items together and medication use, but showed low measurement properties on the single healthcare utilization items.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to validate quantitative performance of a newly released simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, by using MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC), both in phantom study and in patient study. PET/MRI image uniformities of a phantom under different hardware configurations were tested and compared. Thirty patients were examined with 2-deoxy-2-18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) and subsequent PET/MRI. PET images from PET/MRI were corrected with MRAC (PETMR), CT-based attenuation maps (μ-maps, PETCT), and segmented CT μ-maps (PETCTSeg) derived from PET/CT. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were compared among the 3 sets of PET in main organs (bone, liver and lung) and in 52 FDG-avid lesions, including soft-tissue lesions and bone lesions. The result showed that PET imaging uniformities of PET/MRI under different configurations were good (<8.8%). The SUV differences among the 3 sets of PET varied with organs and lesion types. In detail, the mean relative differences of SUV between PETMR and PETCT were as follows: −18.8%, bone (SUVmean); −8.0%, liver (SUVmean); −12.2%, lung (SUVmean); −18.1%, bone lesions (SUVmean); −13.3%, bone lesions (SUVmax); −8.2%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmean); and −7.3%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmax). The mean relative differences between PETMR and PETCTSeg were as follows: −19.0%, bone (SUVmean); −3.5%, liver (SUVmean); −3.3%, lung (SUVmean); −19.3%, bone lesions (SUVmean); −17.5%, bone lesions (SUVmax); −5.5%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmean); and −4.4%, soft-tissue lesions (SUVmax). The differences of SUV between PETMR and PETCT were larger than those between PETMR and PETCTSeg, in both soft tissue and soft-tissue lesions (P<0.001), but not in bone or bone lesions. In conclusion, MRAC in the newly released PET/MR system is accurate in most tissues, with SUV deviations being generally less than 10%, compared to PET/CT. In bone, however, underestimations can be substantial, which may be partially attributed to segmentation of the MR-based μ-maps.},

abstract={AimThe aim was to design an app-based eLearning tool to provide radiographers with information about the physical basis of MR artefacts and practical elimination or/and minimisation strategies to optimise image quality, and to evaluate the impact of a smartphone app on radiographers’ knowledge.MethodsThe study used the comparison-experimental approach (pre- and post-test). Thirty-five MR radiographers independently reviewed a prepared series of MR images (n = 25). The participants were requested to identify image quality related errors, to specify error-correction strategies and to score how confident they were in their responses. Participants were then divided into experimental (n = 19) and control cohorts (n = 16). The app was provided to the experimental cohort for 3 months; after this period both cohorts re-reviewed the MR image datasets and repeated their identification of image quality errors.ResultsThe results showed a statistically significant difference between control and experimental cohorts relative to participants’ pre- to post-test knowledge level. For the experimental cohort, years of experience, qualification and type of hospital were not associated with radiographer knowledge level and confidence in recognising the presence of an image quality error, naming the error and specifying appropriate correction strategies (p > 0.05).ConclusionThe study identified the potential of the smartphone app as an effective educational tool to support MR radiographers’ knowledge in recognising and characterising MR image quality errors.Key Points• A high level of knowledge to optimise MR image quality is crucial.• Ongoing education in image quality optimisation is required.• The potential role of app as an effective educational tool is identified.},

abstract={PurposeCardiac PET-MR has shown potential for the comprehensive assessment of coronary heart disease. However, image degradation due to physiological motion remains a challenge that could hinder the adoption of this technology in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to validate a recently proposed respiratory motion-corrected PET-MR framework for the simultaneous visualisation of myocardial viability (18F-FDG PET) and coronary artery anatomy (coronary MR angiography, CMRA) in patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO).MethodsA cohort of 14 patients was scanned with the proposed PET-CMRA framework. PET and CMRA images were reconstructed with and without the proposed motion correction approach for comparison purposes. Metrics of image quality including visible vessel length and sharpness were obtained for CMRA for both the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries (RCA, LAD), and relative increase in 18F-FDG PET signal after motion correction for standard 17-segment polar maps was computed. Resulting coronary anatomy by CMRA and myocardial integrity by PET were visually compared against X-ray angiography and conventional Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) MRI, respectively.ResultsMotion correction increased CMRA visible vessel length by 49.9% and 32.6% (RCA, LAD) and vessel sharpness by 12.3% and 18.9% (RCA, LAD) on average compared to uncorrected images. Coronary lumen delineation on motion-corrected CMRA images was in good agreement with X-ray angiography findings. For PET, motion correction resulted in an average 8% increase in 18F-FDG signal in the inferior and inferolateral segments of the myocardial wall. An improved delineation of myocardial viability defects and reduced noise in the 18F-FDG PET images was observed, improving correspondence to subendocardial LGE-MRI findings compared to uncorrected images.ConclusionThe feasibility of the PET-CMRA framework for simultaneous cardiac PET-MR imaging in a short and predictable scan time (~11 min) has been demonstrated in 14 patients with CTO. Motion correction increased visible length and sharpness of the coronary arteries by CMRA, and improved delineation of the myocardium by 18F-FDG PET, resulting in good agreement with X-ray angiography and LGE-MRI.},

abstract={Objectives To validate MR textural analysis (MRTA) for detection of transition zone (TZ) prostate cancer through comparison with co-registered prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-MR. Methods Retrospective analysis was performed for 30 men who underwent simultaneous PSMA PET-MR imaging for staging of prostate cancer. Thirty texture features were derived from each manually contoured T2-weighted, transaxial, prostatic TZ using texture analysis software that applies a spatial band-pass filter and quantifies texture through histogram analysis. Texture features of the TZ were compared to PSMA expression on the corresponding PET images. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction controlled the false discovery rate at <5%. Results Eighty-eight T2-weighted images in 18 patients demonstrated abnormal PSMA expression within the TZ on PET-MR. 123 images were PSMA negative. Based on the corrected p-value of 0.005, significant differences between PSMA positive and negative slices were found for 16 texture parameters: Standard deviation and mean of positive pixels for all spatial filters (p = <0.0001 for both at all spatial scaling factor (SSF) values) and mean intensity following filtration for SSF 3–6 mm (p = 0.0002–0.0018). Conclusion Abnormal expression of PSMA within the TZ is associated with altered texture on T2-weighted MR, providing validation of MRTA for the detection of TZ prostate cancer. Key Points • Prostate transition zone (TZ) MR texture analysis may assist in prostate cancer detection. • Abnormal transition zone PSMA expression correlates with altered texture on T2-weighted MR. • TZ with abnormal PSMA expression demonstrates significantly reduced MI, SD and MPP.},

abstract={Better understanding of agglomeration behavior of nonmetallic inclusions in the steelmaking process is important to control the cleanliness of the steel. In this work, a revision on the Paunov simplified model has been made according to the original Kralchevsky-Paunov model. Thus, this model has been applied to quantitatively calculate the attractive capillary force on inclusions agglomerating at the liquid steel/gas interface. Moreover, the agglomeration behavior of Al2O3 inclusions at a low carbon steel/Ar interface has been observed in situ by high-temperature confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The velocity and acceleration of inclusions and attractive forces between Al2O3 inclusions of various sizes were calculated based on the CLSM video. The results calculated using the revised model offered a reasonable fit with the present experimental data for different inclusion sizes. Moreover, a quantitative comparison was made between calculations using the equivalent radius of a circle and those using the effective radius. It was found that the calculated capillary force using equivalent radius offered a better fit with the present experimental data because of the inclusion characteristics. Comparing these results with other studies in the literature allowed the authors to conclude that when applied in capillary force calculations, the equivalent radius is more suitable for inclusions with large size and irregular shape, and the effective radius is more appropriate for inclusions with small size or a large shape factor. Using this model, the effect of inclusion size on attractive capillary force has been investigated, demonstrating that larger inclusions are more strongly attracted.},

abstract={Objectives Improved real-time cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) sequences have currently been introduced, but so far only limited practical experience exists. This study aimed at image reconstruction optimization and clinical validation of a new highly accelerated real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE sequence. Methods Left ventricular (LV) short-axis stacks of a real-time free-breathing SPARSE-SENSE sequence with high spatiotemporal resolution and of a standard segmented cine SSFP sequence were acquired at 1.5 T in 11 volunteers and 15 patients. To determine the optimal iterations, all volunteers' SPARSE-SENSE images were reconstructed using 10-200 iterations, and contrast ratios, image entropies, and reconstruction times were assessed. Subsequently, the patients' SPARSE-SENSE images were reconstructed with the clinically optimal iterations. LV volumetric values were evaluated and compared between both sequences. Results Sufficient image quality and acceptable reconstruction times were achieved when using 80 iterations. Bland-Altman plots and Passing-Bablok regression showed good agreement for all volumetric parameters. Conclusions 80 iterations are recommended for iterative SPARSE-SENSE image reconstruction in clinical routine. Real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE yielded comparable volumetric results as the current standard SSFP sequence. Due to its intrinsic low image acquisition times, real-time cine SPARSE-SENSE imaging with iterative image reconstruction seems to be an attractive alternative for LV function analysis. Key Points * A highly accelerated real-time CMR sequence using SPARSE-SENSE was evaluated. * SPARSE-SENSE allows free breathing in real-time cardiac cine imaging. * For clinically optimal SPARSE-SENSE image reconstruction, 80 iterations are recommended. * Real-time SPARSE-SENSE imaging yielded comparable volumetric results as the reference SSFP sequence. * The fast SPARSE-SENSE sequence is an attractive alternative to standard SSFP sequences.},

abstract={Background Up to 80 % of cartilage is water; the rest is collagen fibers and proteoglycans. Magnetic resonance (MR) T1-weighted measurements can be employed to calculate the water content of a tissue using T1 mapping. In this study, a method that translates T1 values into water content data was tested statistically. Materials and methods To develop a predictive equation, T1 values were obtained for tissue-mimicking gelatin samples. 1.5 T MRI was performed using inverse angle phase and an inverse sequence at 37 (±0.5) °C. Regions of interest were manually delineated and the mean T1 value was estimated in arbitrary units. Data were collected and modeled using linear regression. To validate the method, articular cartilage from six healthy pigs was used. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the Danish Animal Experiment Committee. Double measurements were performed for each animal. Ex vivo, all water in the tissue was extracted by lyophilization, thus allowing the volume of water to be measured. This was then compared with the predicted water content via Lin's concordance correlation coefficient at the 95 % confidence level. Results The mathematical model was highly significant when compared to a null model (p < 0.0001). 97.3 % of the variation in water content can be explained by absolute T1 values. Percentage water content could be predicted as 0.476 + (T1 value) × 0.000193 × 100 %. We found that there was 98 % concordance between the actual and predicted water contents. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate that MR data can be used to predict percentage water contents of cartilage samples. Level of evidence 3 (case-control study).},

Yet, the existing asymptotic analysis of this test statistic is limited to a model in which the errors are assumed to follow a simple AR(1) structure with homogenous autoregressive coefficients. One reason for this is that the model involves an intricate identification issue, as both the serial and cross-section correlation structures of the errors are unobserved. The purpose of the current paper is to tackle this issue and in so doing extend the existing analysis to the case of AR(......) errors with possibly heterogeneous coefficients.},

abstract={Targeting the nonstationary and non-Gaussian characteristics of vibration signal from fault rolling bearing, this paper proposes a fault feature extraction method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and autoregressive (AR) model parameters. Firstly, VMD is applied to decompose vibration signals and a series of stationary component signals can be obtained. Secondly, AR model is established for each component mode. Thirdly, the parameters and remnant of AR model served as fault characteristic vectors. Finally, a novel random forest (RF) classifier is put forward for pattern recognition in the field of rolling bearing fault diagnosis. The validity and superiority of proposed method are verified by an experimental dataset. Analysis results show that this method based on VMD-AR model can extract fault features accurately and RF classifier has been proved to outperform comparative classifiers.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) perfusion MR imaging for distinguishing tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect as alternatives to dynamic-susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion MR imaging when the DSC image is uninterpretable. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. Seventy one post-treatment glioblastoma patients who showed enlarged contrast-enhancing lesions on follow-up MR images after concurrent chemoradiotherapy and uninterpretable DSC images for corresponding enhancing lesions, underwent additional DWI and DCE MR imaging. The primary outcome was the frequency of interpretable DWI and DCE MR cases in these 71 patients. The secondary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of DWI and DCE imaging parameters for distinguishing tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images. The imaging parameters were quantified as 10% cumulative histogram cutoff of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC10) and 90% cumulative histogram cutoff of initial area under the time signal intensity curve (IAUC90). The AUCs were cross-validated by using leave-one-out method. Results Of the 71 patients, the uninterpretable DSC images were associated with treatment-related hemorrhage within the corresponding enhancing lesions (n = 54, 76.1%) and a near skull base location (n = 17, 23.9%). The frequencies of interpretable DWI and DCE image were 51 (71.8%) and 59 (83.1%) of the 71 cases with uninterpretable DSC images, respectively. Of the 45 selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images, the combination of DWI with DCE imaging showed a superior diagnostic performance than DWI or DCE imaging alone for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect (cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.55 and 0.73 for reader 1; cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.53 and 0.75 for reader 2, respectively). Cross-validated accuracy of the single and combined imaging parameters also showed the highest for the combination of DWI with DCE MR imaging (72.9% for reader 1; 72.5% for reader 2) and the lowest for DWI alone (54.0% for reader 1; 56.4% for reader 2). Inter-reader agreement for DCE imaging was higher than that for DWI (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.95 versus 0.87). Conclusion DCE MR imaging could be a superior and more reproducible imaging biomarker than DWI for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in patients with post-treatment glioblastoma when DSC MR images are not interpretable.},

abstract={Background We performed a pilot study using a single virtual-simulation suturing module as an objective measurement to determine functional use of the robotic system. This study will assist in designing a study for an objective, adjunctive test for use by a surgical proctor. Methods After IRB approval, subjects were recruited at a robotic renal surgery course to perform two attempts of the "Tubes" module without warm-up using the Da Vinci® Surgical Skills Simulator(TM). The overall MScore (%) from the simulator was compared among various skill levels to provide construct validity. Correlation with MScore and number of robotic cases was performed and pre-determined skill groups were tested. Nine metrics that make up the overall score were also tested via paired t test and subsequent logistic regression to determine which skills differed among experienced and novice robotic surgeons. Results We enrolled 38 subjects with experience ranging from 0- < 200 robotic cases. Median time to complete both tasks was less than 10 min. The MScore on the first attempt was correlated to the number of previous robotic cases (R2 = 0.465; p = 0.003). MScore was different between novice and more experienced robotic surgeons on the first (44.7 vs. 63.9; p = 0.005) and second attempt (56.0 vs. 69.9; p = 0.037).

abstract={Several methods have been proposed to estimate the force of a semiactive damper, particularly of a magnetorheological damper because of its importance in automotive and civil engineering. Usually, all models have been proposed assuming experimental data in nominal operating conditions and some of them are estimated for control purposes. Because dampers are prone to fail, fault estimation is useful to design adaptive vibration controllers to accommodate the malfunction in the suspension system. This paper deals with the diagnosis and estimation of faults in an automotive magnetorheological damper. A robust LPV observer is proposed to estimate the lack of force caused by a damper leakage in a vehicle corner. Once the faulty damper is isolated in the vehicle and the fault is estimated, an Adaptive Vibration Control System is proposed to reduce the fault effect using compensation forces from the remaining healthy dampers. To fulfill the semiactive damper constraints in the fault adaptation, an LPV controller is designed for vehicle comfort and road holding. Simulation results show that the fault observer has good performance with robustness to noise and road disturbances and the proposed AVCS improves the comfort up to 24% with respect to a controlled suspension without fault tolerance features.},

abstract={Introduction: Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia. The main objective of this study was to compare the performances of PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) with PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and a control group (CG) using a traditional assessment of executive functions and the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality-based tool. In order to understand which subcomponents of executive functions are early impaired, this experimental study aimed to investigate specifically which instrument best discriminates among these three groups. Materials and methods: The study included three groups of 15 individuals each (for a total of 45 participants): 15 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC); 15 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and 15 cognitively healthy individuals (CG). To assess the global neuropsychological functioning and the executive functions, several tests (including the Mini Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, and Tower of London test) were administered to the participants. The VMET was used for a more ecologically valid neuropsychological evaluation of executive functions. Results: Findings revealed significant differences in the VMET scores between the PD-NC patients versus the controls. In particular, patients made more errors in the tasks of the VMET, and showed a poorer ability to use effective strategies to complete the tasks. This VMET result seems to be more sensitive in the early detection of executive deficits because these two groups did not differ in the traditional assessment of executive functions (neuropsychological battery). Conclusion: This study offers initial evidence that a more ecologically valid evaluation of executive functions is more likely to lead to detection of subtle executive deficits.},

abstract={The level set approach to segmentation of medical images has received considerable attention in recent years. Evolving an initial contour to converge to anatomical boundaries of an organ or tumor is a very appealing method, especially when it is based on a well-defined mathematical foundation. However, one drawback of such evolving method is its high computation time. It is desirable to design and implement algorithms that are not only accurate and robust but also fast in execution. Bresson et al. have proposed a variational model using both boundary and region information as well as shape priors. The latter can be a significant factor in medical image analysis. In this work, we combine the variational model of level set with a multi-resolution approach to accelerate the processing. The question is whether a multi-resolution context can make the segmentation faster without affecting the accuracy. As well, we investigate the question whether a premature convergence, which happens in a much shorter time, would reduce accuracy. We examine multiple semiautomated configurations to segment the prostate gland in T2W MR images. Comprehensive experimentation is conducted using a data set of a 100 patients (1,235 images) to verify the effectiveness of the multi-resolution level set with shape priors. The results show that the convergence speed can be increased by a factor of asymptotically =]2.5 without affecting the segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, a premature convergence approach drastically increases the segmentation speed by a factor of asymptotically =]17.9.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={An effective damper is required to give good performance over a wide range of vibrational frequencies. To achieve this, the damping coefficient of the damper must be variable. The Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids are the fluids used in this type of dampers to achieve the objective. In this paper, a mathematical design of the MR damper is presented. For this, the magnetic circuit of the MR damper is designed and analyzed, which subsequently determines the damping force at different magnetic fields applied to it. The magnetic field can be controlled by the current input given to the electromagnet. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on ANSYS platform is carried out to obtain magnetic flux density in the working space of the damper. The damping force of the FEM model is determined for the damper. Lastly, these two models are validated experimentally in terms of damping force at various input current levels. For this purpose, a prototype of the MR damper is fabricated and tested in the newly setup vibration control laboratory of the department. A comparative analysis of the three models shows that the maximum percentage error in the damping force is within the 12% level with the experimental one and thus validates the mathematical and FEM modeling. The results obtained will be helpful for the automobile designers to create more efficient and reliable MR dampers and also to predict its damping force characteristics.},

abstract={Issue Title: Special Issue: Validating cyber-interventions Previous investigations conducted on post-secondary adult students with learning disabilities (LD) suggest that deficits in visual-motor skills contribute to difficulties in written expression which impact academic achievement. Intervention strategies for individuals with LD include assistive computer-based technologies (ATs) to compensate for or maximize performance. However, research fails to assess the impact of ATs on performance, learning, and motivation of students with LD. Also, one of the limitations of ATs is that they cannot be used for assessment and training and there are very few methods to assess or train visual-motor skills in this population. The present study explores the usefulness of a hapto-visual virtual reality motor skills assessment (MSA) device for visual-motor functioning in adults with and without LD. This is a preliminary step of developing an intervention to improve impaired visual-motor skills in adults with LD. A sample of 22 male and female university students with and without LD had their visual-motor skills pretested using a standard paper-and-pencil Bender-Gestalt (BG) test and were compared according to their performance on the MSA tool. We hypothesized that our LD participants' performance would be significantly lower than our control participants on the VR task in terms of number of errors and speed. Results showed that participants without LD performed better and more rapidly on the VR task than participants with LD. There were no correlations between the BG and MSA performance. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the Bender-Gestalt scores, previous experience with video game, arousal, and mood. Our results suggest that a novel 3D virtual reality tool such as the MSA can potentially discriminate motor function of people with and without LD; however, the difference between both may also be due to a lack of problem-solving ability in LD.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Objective. With the increase in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery there is a concomitant rising demand for training methods. The objective was to establish face and construct validity of a novel virtual reality simulator (dV-Trainer, Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA) for the use in training of robot-assisted surgery. Methods. A comparative cohort study was performed. Participants (n=42 ) were divided into three groups according to their robotic experience. To determine construct validity, participants performed three different exercises twice. Performance parameters were measured. To determine face validity, participants filled in a questionnaire after completion of the exercises. Results. Experts outperformed novices in most of the measured parameters. The most discriminative parameters were "time to complete" and "economy of motion" (P<0.001 ). The training capacity of the simulator was rated 4.6 ± 0.5 SD on a 5-point Likert scale. The realism of the simulator in general, visual graphics, movements of instruments, interaction with objects, and the depth perception were all rated as being realistic. The simulator is considered to be a very useful training tool for residents and medical specialist starting with robotic surgery. Conclusions. Face and construct validity for the dV-Trainer could be established. The virtual reality simulator is a useful tool for training robotic surgery.},

abstract={There is a close relation between cartilage health and its hydration state. Current magnetic resonance methods allow visualizing this tissue. However, a quantitative analysis is more useful when studying disease. The purpose of this study was to quantify water content in cartilage using magnetic resonance without contrast agents. Water-content estimations using T1 magnetic resonance mapping were done first in eight gelatin samples where the water content was previously known. The same method was used in the physeal areas of eight skeletally immature 30-kg pigs. To calculate accuracy, T1 calculations were compared to dry-freeze, which is considered the gold standard because it can remove the total water content form a tissue. Four fresh cartilage and seven gelatin samples were dry-frozen. Water content obtained from dry-freeze was compared to the one calculated from T1 map values. A mathematical model and statistical analysis were used to calculate the predictive value of the method and its significance. T1-map-based magnetic resonance method can calculate water content in cartilage with an accuracy of 97.3 %. We calculated a coefficient of variance for this method against dry-frozen sample of 3.68 (SD=1.2) in gelatin samples, and 2.73 (SD=1.3) in in vivo samples. Between two independent observers, the coefficient of variance was 0.053, which suggests it can be easily reproduced. Magnetic resonance was able to calculate, with high accuracy, the cartilage water content using T1 mapping sequences.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Polar motion depicts the slow changes in the locations of the poles due to the earth's internal instantaneous axis of rotation. The LS+AR model is recognized as one of the best models for polar motion prediction. Through statistical analysis of the time series of the LS+AR model's short-term prediction residuals, we found that there is a good correlation of model prediction residuals between adjacent terms. These indicate that the preceding model prediction residuals and experiential adjustment matrixes can be used to correct the next prediction results, thereby forming a new LS+AR model with additional error correction that applies to polar motion prediction. Simulated predictions using this new model revealed that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and reliability of polar motion prediction. In fact, the accuracies of ultra short-term and short-term predictions using the new model were equal to the international best level at present.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Before diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be implemented in standard clinical practice for response monitoring, data on reproducibility are needed to assess which differences outside the range of normal variation can be detected in an individual patient. In this study we assessed the reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in colorectal liver metastases. To provide a biological basis for these values, their relation with histopathology was assessed. DWI was performed twice in 1 week in patients scheduled for metastasectomy of colorectal liver metastases. Correlation between ADC values and apoptosis marker p53, anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, proliferation marker Ki67 and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration were assessed. A good reproducibility coefficient of the mean ADC (coefficient of reproducibility 0.20 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s) was observed in colorectal liver metastases (n=21). The ADC value was related to the proliferation index and BCL-2 expression of the metastases. Furthermore, in metastases recently treated with systemic therapy, the ADC was significantly higher (1.27 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s vs 1.05 × 10^sup -3^mm^sup 2^/s, P=0.02). The good reproducibility, correlation with histopathology and implied sensitivity for systemic treatment-induced anti-tumour effects suggest that DWI might be an excellent tool to monitor response in metastatic colorectal cancer. * ADC values are becoming important oncological biomarkers * DWI provides reproducibile ADC values in colorectal liver metastases * The coefficient of reproducibility of the mean ADC is 0.20 × 10 ^sup -3^ mm ^sup 2^ /s * ADC values correlate with proliferation index and are related to BCL-2 expression PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Compared with X-ray coronary angiography (CAG), magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary vessel wall (MR-CVW) may provide more information about plaque burden and coronary remodelling. We compared MR-CVW with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), the standard of reference for coronary vessel wall imaging, with regard to plaque detection and wall thickness measurements. In this study 17 patients with chest pain, who had been referred for CAG, were included. Patients underwent IVUS and MR-CVW imaging of the right coronary artery (RCA). Subsequently, the coronary vessel wall was analysed for the presence and location of coronary plaques. Fifty-two matching RCA regions of interest were available for comparison. There was good agreement between IVUS and MR-CVW for qualitative assessment of presence of disease, with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 76%. Wall thickness measurements demonstrated a significant difference between mean wall thickness on IVUS and MR-CVW (0.48 vs 1.24 mm, P<0.001), but great heterogeneity between wall thickness measurements, resulting in a low correlation between IVUS and MR-CVW. MR-CVW has high sensitivity for the detection of coronary vessel wall thickening in the RCA compared with IVUS. However, the use of MRI for accurate absolute wall thickness measurements is not supported when a longitudinal acquisition orientation is used. * Both MRI and IVUS can assess coronary vessels * Both MRI and IVUS can identify coronary vessel wall thickening. * MRI provides more information about the coronary plaque burden than conventional angiography. * However, MRI overestimates absolute coronary wall thickness when compared with IVUS.

abstract={Objectives The purpose of our study was to assess the chondrogenic potential and the MR signal effects of GadofluorineM-Cy labeled matrix associated stem cell implants (MASI) in pig knee specimen. Materials and Methods Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were labeled with the micelle-based contrast agent GadofluorineM-Cy. Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs, non-labeled hMSCs and scaffold only served as controls. Chondrogenic differentiation was induced and gene expression and histologic evaluation were performed. The proportions of spindle-shaped vs. round cells of chondrogenic pellets were compared between experimental groups using the Fisher's exact test. Labeled and unlabeled hMSCs and chondrocytes in scaffolds were implanted into cartilage defects of porcine femoral condyles and underwent MR imaging with T1- and T2-weighted SE and GE sequences. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) between implants and adjacent cartilage were determined and analyzed for significant differences between different experimental groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance was assigned for p0.017). However, hMSC differentiation into chondrocytes was superior for unlabeled and GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled cells compared with Ferucarbotran-labeled cells, as evidenced by a significantly higher proportion of spindle cells in chondrogenic pellets (p<0.05). GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled hMSCs and chondrocytes showed a positive signal effect on T1-weighted images and a negative signal effect on T2-weighted images while Ferucarbotran-labeled cells provided a negative signal effect on all sequences. CNR data for both GadofluorineM-Cy-labeled and Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs were significantly different compared to unlabeled control cells on T1-weighted SE and T2*-weighted MR images (p<0.017). Conclusion hMSCs can be labeled by simple incubation with GadofluorineM-Cy. The labeled cells provide significant MR signal effects and less impaired chondrogenesis compared to Ferucarbotran-labeled hMSCs. Thus, GadoflurineM-Cy might represent an alternative MR cell marker to Ferucarbotran, which is not distributed any more in Europe or North America.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to experimentally validate the performance of a semi-active suspension incorporating a magneto-rheological damper (MR), where the parameters of the numerical models are often poorly adapted to real responses measured experimentally. To ensure a better representation of a real semi-active suspension, we must consider the internal dynamics of the MR damper in its numerical modeling. By adopting models which demonstrate that dynamic, such as the Bingham and Bouc-Wen models, we can approach the measured responses by adjusting their internal parameters. The law control introduction for feedback control of the semi-active suspension incorporating the internal dynamics of the MR damper allows, through the analysis of its robustness and response time, to better assess its performance. To validate the performance of these models, a comparative analysis was made between the experimentally measured responses by the dSPACE system used as an acquisition and control chain and the calculated or predicted responses. A rapprochement between measured responses and those calculated for the same dynamic characteristics of the test bed is possible by adjusting the most influential parameters of Bouc-Wen model.},

Accelerated life test of rolling bearings in Hangzhou Bearing Test & Research Center (HBRC) was performed to collect vibration data over their entire lifetime (normal-fault-failure). The result shows that SK can detect early incipient fault by eliminating some other interfering frequency components. In addition, it can detect fault 5 min earlier than root mean value (RMS).

abstract={Doc number: 150 Abstract Background: Clematichinenoside AR is a promising lead compound for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A systematic research for the related impurities in AR bulk samples is still lacking. For the safe use of this natural product in future clinical practice, the structure and content of each constituent, including the main ingredient as well as the impurities in AR bulk sample must be characterized in detail. Results: A simple and stability indicating RP-HPLC method was developed and validated for determining the purity of clematichinenoside AR (AR), a natural product from the roots of Clematis manshurica Rupr. (Ranunculaceae) with the potential of treating rheumatoid arthritis. Five impurities were characterized, and impurity 2 (Clematomandshurica saponin F) is a new triterpenoid saponin isolated from this product. Optimum separation for clematichinenoside AR and five related impurities was carried out on an Agilent octadecylsilane bonded silica gel column (TC-C18, 4.6 mm ×150 mm, 5 μm) using a gradient HPLC method. The validation results showed good sensitivity, specificity, linearity(r2 >0.9992) precision(RSD<1.63%), accuracy(recoveries in the range of 95.60%-104.76%) and robustness. Three AR bulk samples containing all the impurities were examined by two methods, and the stability of correction factors for the determination of related impurities was discussed. The proposed stability-indicating method was suitable for the quality control of this natural product. Conclusion: Five related impurities of clematichinenoside AR were characterized, including a new triterpenoid saponins firstly found in clematichinenoside AR bulk samples. In the simple chromatographic method for determining clematichinenoside AR and its related impurities in bulk samples, the correction factor was better for the quality control in the relative stable concentrations.},

Although the initiation of the thrust has recently been conjectured to occur during the Middle Jurassic Daebo tectonic event in a continental magmatic arc setting, its movement history has never been studied. We report timing of brittle reactivation of the thrust obtained from K-Ar dating of fault gouges in the core of the Deokpori Thrust zone. K-Ar illite age data of fault gouges suggest reactivation of the thrust at ca. 72 Ma after a contact metamorphism around 94 Ma. Our result is the first documentation of the reactivation of a major Jurassic Daebo structure and the reactivation may represent a significant contractional tectonic event during the Late Cretaceous in the Korean Peninsula.},

abstract={The Sierras Pampeanas in central and north-western Argentina constitute a distinct morphotectonic feature between 27°S and 33°S. The last stage of uplift and deformation in this area are interpreted to be closely related to the Andean flat-slab subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate. K-Ar fault gouge dating and low-temperature thermochronology along two transects within the Sierra de Comechingones reveal a minimum age for the onset of brittle deformation about 340 Ma, very low exhumation rates since Late Paleozoic time, as well as a total exhumation of about 2.3 km since the Late Cretaceous. New Ar-Ar ages (7.54-1.91 Ma) of volcanic rocks from the San Luis volcanic belt support the eastward propagation of the flat-slab magmatic front, confirming the onset of flat-slab related deformation in this region at 11.2 Ma. Although low-temperature thermochronology does not clearly constrain the signal of the Andean uplift, it is understood that the current structural relief related to the Comechingones range has been achieved after the exhumation of both fault walls (circa 80-70 Ma).PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Multimodal approaches are of growing interest in the study of neural processes. To this end much attention has been paid to the integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data because of their complementary properties. However, the simultaneous acquisition of both types of data causes serious artifacts in the EEG, with amplitudes that may be much larger than those of EEG signals themselves. The most challenging of these artifacts is the ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact, caused by pulse-related electrode movements inside the magnetic field. Despite numerous efforts to find a suitable approach to remove this artifact, still a considerable discrepancy exists between current EEG-fMRI studies. This paper attempts to clarify several methodological issues regarding the different approaches with an extensive validation based on event-related potentials (ERPs). More specifically, Optimal Basis Set (OBS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based methods were investigated. Their validation was not only performed with measures known from previous studies on the average ERPs, but most attention was focused on task-related measures, including their use on trial-to-trial information. These more detailed validation criteria enabled us to find a clearer distinction between the most widely used cleaning methods. Both OBS and ICA proved to be able to yield equally good results. However, ICA methods needed more parameter tuning, thereby making OBS more robust and easy to use. Moreover, applying OBS prior to ICA can optimize the data quality even more, but caution is recommended since the effect of the additional ICA step may be strongly subject-dependent.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of adding combined 18F-PET/CT to MRI for T and N staging of the oral and oropharyngeal cancer and calculation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) having histopathology as reference standard. PET/CT and MRI were performed in 66 patients with suspected oral and oropharyngeal cancer (41 primary tumors/25 recurrent tumors) and nodal disease (114 nodes). Statistical analysis included the McNemar test, sensitivity, specificity for the diagnostic modalities as well as regression analysis, and Bland-Altman graphs for calculated tumor volumes. There was no statistically significant difference between the two modalities compared to pathological findings regarding detection of disease (P≥0.72). The sensitivity/specificity for tumor detection were 100/80% and 96.72/60% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. The sensitivity/specificity for nodal metastases were 88.46/75% and 83.81/73.91% for MRI and PET/CT, respectively. In 18% of cases, the MRI-based T staging resulted in an overestimation of the pathologic tumor stage. The corresponding rate for PET/CT was 22%. Regarding the treated necks, both modalities showed 100% sensitivity for detection of the recurrent lesions. In necks with histologically N0 staging, MRI and PET/CT gave 22% and 26% false positive findings, respectively. The mean tumor volume in the pathologic specimen was 16.6±18.6 ml, the mean volume derived by the MR imaging was 17.6±19.1 ml while the estimated by PET/CT volume was 18.8±18.1 ml (P≤0.007 between the three methods). The Bland-Altman analysis showed a better agreement between PET/CT and MRI. The diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in the local staging of oral cancer is not superior to MRI.

abstract={The purpose of this study was to validate a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for mapping liver fat, using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) as the reference standard. In 91 patients with type 2 diabetes, 3.0-T single-voxel point-resolved 1H-MRS was used to calculate the liver fat fraction (LFF) from the water (4.76 ppm) and methylene (1.33 ppm) peaks, corrected for T1 and T2 decays. LFF (corrected for T1 and T2* decays) was also obtained from the mean signal intensity on a map built from a triple-echo (consecutive in-phase, opposed-phase, and in-phase echo times) breath-hold gradient echo sequence, using basic image calculation functions (arithmetic mean, subtraction, division, multiplication by a numerical factor). Mean LFF was 8.9% (range, 0.9-33.5) by MRI and 8.8% (range, 0-34.1) by 1H-MRS. Pearson's coefficient was 0.976 (P<0.0001) and Lin's coefficient was 0.975 (P<0.0001). Liver segment had no significant influence. With Bland-Altman analysis, 95.6% (87/91) of data points were within the limits of agreement. Given its excellent agreement with 1H-MRS, our mapping technique can be used for visual and quantitative evaluation of liver fat in everyday practice.},

abstract={This study proposes magnetic resonance (MR)-measurement-integrated (MR-MI) simulation, in which the difference between the computed velocity field and the phase-contrast MRI measurement data is fed back to the numerical simulation. The computational accuracy and the fundamental characteristics, such as steady characteristics and transient characteristics, of the MR-MI simulation were investigated by a numerical experiment. We dealt with reproduction of three-dimensional steady and unsteady blood flow fields in a realistic cerebral aneurysm developed at a bifurcation. The MR-MI simulation reduced the error derived from the incorrect boundary conditions in the blood flow in the cerebral aneurysm. For the reproduction of steady and unsteady standard solutions, the error of velocity decreased to 13% and to 22% in one cardiac cycle, respectively, compared with the ordinary simulation without feedback. Moreover, the application of feedback shortened the computational convergence, and thus the convergent solution and periodic solution were obtained within less computational time in the MR-MI simulation than that in the ordinary simulation. The dividing flow ratio toward the two outlets after bifurcation was well estimated owing to the improvement of computational accuracy. Furthermore, the MR-MI simulation yielded wall shear stress distribution on the cerebral aneurysm of the standard solution accurately and in detail.},

abstract={Two grabens were developed in the Yi-Shu segment of the Tan-Lu fault zone (TLFZ) during its extensional activities, and are now confined by four major NNE-trending normal faults and filled with Cretaceous sediments. These faults were developed due to their reactivities, containing gouge and cutting the graben sediments. Detailed fieldwork demonstrates that the faults experienced sinistral transtensional moment related to regional NE-SW extension during the reactivity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the finest gouge samples gives illite crystallinity values higher than 0.42°Δ2theta], indicating temperatures experienced by the gouge samples were less than 150°C. From the relation between K-Ar data and proportions of detrital illite in different size fractions of the gouge samples, we conclude that refaulting for the western boundary fault of the TLFZ, abbreviated to F4, took place at ca. 90 Ma and for the eastern boundary fault, abbreviated to F1, happened from 70 to 60 Ma. During the two phases of reactivity imposed by the same NE-SW extension, the TLFZ experienced uplifting and no sediments were deposited in the two grabens. It is suggested that the TLFZ experienced extension during the Late Cretaceous, which supports the inference that lithospheric thinning was still undergoing in the east of the North China Craton during the Late Cretaceous magmatic hiatus.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Objective To develop and validate a tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in individual subjects using support vector machine (SVM)-based classification of structural MR (sMR) images. Background Libraries of sMR scans of clinically well characterized subjects can be harnessed for the purpose of diagnosing new incoming subjects. Methods One hundred ninety patients with probable AD were age- and gender-matched with 190 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Three different classification models were implemented: Model I uses tissue densities obtained from sMR scans to give STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score; and Models II and III use tissue densities as well as covariates (demographics and Apolipoprotein E genotype) to give adjusted-STAND (aSTAND)-score. Data from 140 AD and 140 CN were used for training. The SVM parameter optimization and training were done by four-fold cross validation (CV). The remaining independent sample of 50 AD and 50 CN was used to obtain a minimally biased estimate of the generalization error of the algorithm. Results The CV accuracy of Model II and Model III aSTAND-scores was 88.5% and 89.3%, respectively, and the developed models generalized well on the independent test data sets. Anatomic patterns best differentiating the groups were consistent with the known distribution of neurofibrillary AD pathology. Conclusions This paper presents preliminary evidence that application of SVM-based classification of an individual sMR scan relative to a library of scans can provide useful information in individual subjects for diagnosis of AD. Including demographic and genetic information in the classification algorithm slightly improves diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract={Objective: In the field of cardiac MR image segmentation, active contour models, or snakes have been extensively used, owing to their promising results and to the numerous extensions proposed to improve their performance. This paper explores a methodology for evaluating cardiac MR image segmentation algorithms, which assesses the distance between computer-generated and the observer's hand-outlined boundaries. This metric was applied to various external force extensions of the traditional snake, since no systematic comparison has been performed. Materials and methods: Cardiac MRI from six patients were analyzed. Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T MR scanner with ECG-gated balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequences. Segmentation performances were established for traditional snake, gradient vector flow snake, standard- and guided- pressure force-based snake. The use of a pre-treatment with non-linear anisotropic filtering was also compared to non-filtered images. Results: Agreement between manual and segmentation algorithms was satisfactory for ejection fraction for every segmentation scheme. However end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were systematically underestimated. Conclusion: The developed regional error metric provided a more rigorous evaluation of the segmentation schemes in comparison to the classical derived parameters based on left ventricle volume estimation, usually used in functional cardiac MR studies. These derived parameters can furthermore mask local segmentation errors. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={Simulated deformations and images can act as the gold standard for evaluating various template-based image segmentation and registration algorithms. Traditional deformable simulation methods, such as the use of analytic deformation fields or the displacement of landmarks followed by some form of interpolation, are often unable to construct rich (complex) and/or realistic deformations of anatomical organs. This paper presents new methods aiming to automatically simulate realistic inter- and intra-individual deformations. The paper first describes a statistical approach to capturing inter-individual variability of high-deformation fields from a number of examples (training samples). In this approach, Wavelet-Packet Transform (WPT) of the training deformations and their Jacobians, in conjunction with a Markov random field (MRF) spatial regularization, are used to capture both coarse and fine characteristics of the training deformations in a statistical fashion. Simulated deformations can then be constructed by randomly sampling the resultant statistical distribution in an unconstrained or a landmark-constrained fashion. The paper also describes a model for generating tissue atrophy or growth in order to simulate intra-individual brain deformations. Several sets of simulated deformation fields and respective images are generated, which can be used in the future for systematic and extensive validation studies of automated atlas-based segmentation and deformable registration methods. The code and simulated data are available through our Web site.},

abstract={As population-based epidemiologic studies may acquire images from thousands of subjects, automated image post-processing is needed. However, error in these methods may be biased and related to subject characteristics relevant to the research question. Here, we compare two automated methods of brain extraction against manually segmented images and evaluate whether method accuracy is associated with subject demographic and health characteristics. MRI data (n = 296) are from the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, a population-based study of elderly Japanese-American men. The intracranial space was manually outlined on the axial proton density sequence by a single operator. The brain was extracted automatically using BET (Brain Extraction Tool) and BSE (Brain Surface Extractor) on axial proton density images. Total intracranial volume was calculated for the manually segmented images (ticvM), the BET segmented images (ticvBET) and the BSE segmented images (ticvBSE). Mean ticvBSE was closer to that of ticvM, but ticvBET was more highly correlated with ticvM than ticvBSE. BSE had significant over (positive error) and underestimated (negative error) ticv, but net error was relatively low. BET had large positive and very low negative error. Method accuracy, measured in percent positive and negative error, varied slightly with age, head circumference, presence of the apolipoprotein estraight epsilon]4 polymorphism, subcortical and cortical infracts and enlarged ventricles. This epidemiologic approach to the assessment of potential bias in image post-processing tasks shows both skull-stripping programs performed well in this large image dataset when compared to manually segmented images. Although method accuracy was statistically associated with some subject characteristics, the extent of the misclassification (in terms of percent of brain volume) was small.},

abstract={Image registration integrates information from different imaging modalities and has the potential to improve determination of target volume in radiotherapy planning. This paper describes the implementation and validation of a 3D fully automated registration procedure in the process of radiotherapy treatment planning of brain tumors. Fifteen patients with various brain tumors received computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) brain imaging before the start of radiotherapy. First, the normalized mutual information (NMI) method was used for image registration. Registration accuracy was estimated by performing statistical analysis of coordinate differences between CT and MR anatomical landmarks along the x‐, y‐ and z‐axes. Second, a visual validation protocol was developed to validate the quality of individual registration solutions, and this protocol was tested in a series of 36 CT‐MR registration procedures with intentionally applied registration errors. The mean coordinate differences between CT and MR landmarks along the x‐ and y‐axes were in general within 0.5 mm. The mean coordinate differences along the z‐axis were within 1.0 mm, which is of the same magnitude as the applied slice thickness in scanning. In addition, the detection of intentionally applied registration errors by employment of a standardized visual validation protocol resulted in low false‐negative and low false‐positive rates. Application of the NMI method for the brain results in excellent automatic registration accuracy, and the method has been incorporated into the daily routine at our institution. A standardized validation protocol ensures the quality of individual registrations by detecting registration errors with high sensitivity and specificity. This protocol is proposed for the validation of other linear registration methods.PACS numbers: 87.53.Xd, 87.57.Gg},

abstract={Cerebral development is governed by genetic and environmental factors. Animal models provide much of our knowledge about genetic influences in the brain but it is not clear how similar or relevant these are to the human brain. The investigation of human subjects with mutations in genes known to be expressed in the developing brain is an alternative approach to improving our understanding of the role of genetic factors in brain development. We investigated 24 subjects with known mutations in thePAX6gene (including representatives of all the known mutations of the gene) which are associated with characteristic ocular abnormalities in humans and animals. We have quantified MRI data using several techniques to assess qualities of cerebral structure which are difficult to interpret visually. Abnormalities were identified using voxel-based morphometry, statistical morphometrics, and measurement of corpus callosum cross-sectional area when comparing data from subjects withPAX6abnormality and 72 age-and sex-matched control subjects. These abnormalities include grey matter changes in the cerebellum and occipital poles and white matter loss in the corpus callosum, alteration of sulcal orientation in the occipital lobe, and alteration to overall neuronal connectivity. These abnormalities complement and exceed the changes seen in the mouse models, and those seen on visual inspection alone of the human MRI data. Structural differences were also identified between the two largest genotype mutation subgroups.},

abstract={Three different geochronological techniques (stepwise-heating, laser-ablation 40Ar/39Ar, Rb-Sr microsampling) have been evaluated for dating fault-generated pseudotachylytes sampled along the Periadriatic Fault System (PAF) of the Alps. Because pseudotachylytes are whole-rock systems composed of melt, clast and alteration phases, chemical control from both Ar isotopes (Cl/K, Ca/K ratios) and EMPA analyses is crucial for their discrimination. When applied to stepwise-heating 40Ar/39Ar analyses, this approach yields accurate melt-related ages, even for complex age spectra. The spatial resolution of laser-ablation 40Ar/39Ar analyses is capable of contrasting melt, clast and alteration phases in situ, provided the clasts are not too fine grained, the latter of which results in integrated "mixed" ages without geological information. Elevated Cl/K and Ca/K ratios were found to be an invaluable indicator for the presence of clast admixture or inherited 40Ar. Due to incomplete isotopic resetting during frictional melting, Rb-Sr microsampling dating did not furnish geologically meaningful ages. On the basis of isotopic disequilibria among pseudotachylyte matrix phases, and independent Rb-Sr microsampling dating of cogenetic (ultra)mylonites, the concordant 40Ar/39Ar pseudotachylyte ages are interpreted as formation ages. The investigated pseudotachylytes altogether reveal a Cretaceous to Miocene history for the entire PAF, consistent with independent geological evidence. Individual faults, however, consistently reveal narrower intervals of enhanced activity lasting a few million years.},

abstract={En el presente trabajo examinamos dos procedimientos de análisis apropiados a un diseño experimental aleatorio con varias medidas consecutivas a lo largo del tiempo para cada una de las unidades experimentales. Un enfoque para el análisis de tales datos consiste en aplicar el tradicional modelo mixto del AVAR con la estructura del error modelada a través de procesos ARMA. Alternativamente, el problema también puede ser considerado desde una perspectiva más general haciendo uso del enfoque multivariado de medidas repetidas. Datos simulados mediante procedimientos de Monte Carlo son empleados para investigar el efecto que el incumplimiento de las asunciones subyacentes a los modelos tiene sobre el grado de sesgadez de los parámetros estimados, sobre la probabilidad empírica de cometer errores Tipo I y sobre la potencia de prueba de los test estadísticos para cada uno de los dos procedimientos.Alternate abstract: Comparison of the power and robustness of AMVAR of repeated measures versus the correspondent mixed model of AVAR with the error including serial dependence. In this research two procedures of analysis for a random experimental desing with several consecutive measures for each experimental unit are analized and composed. To analize this kind of data a traditional mixed model of AVAR with the error structure modeled through ARMA processes can be used. The problem can be worked out as well from a more general perspective, using a multivariate repeated measures approach. Both approaches are compared using simulated data obtaining with Monte Carlo procedures. Special attention was paid to a) the robustness of model parameter estimates when some assumptions are violated, b) the power of statistical test for both procedures.},

abstract={In all the contrivances which have been proposed as oil tests, a most important element has been left out, viz., time; inasmuch as the evil which is experienced from the use of a bad quality of oil is only developed after the lapse of several days, when, by the action of the oil upon the metal with which it is in contact, together with the action of the air, such oils become viscid, and begin to clog instead of facilitating the movements of the parts of the machinery it was intended to lubricate.},
