abstract = {Augmented reality technology adapted for air traffic control tower applications was used to track an OH-58C helicopter in proximity to an airport. A camera and 'see-through' display system was used to measure the registration error of static airport features and dynamic test aircraft. The observed registration errors of the test aircraft were largely attributable to two terms of error: 1) aircraft surveillance transport latency, and 2) registration error (from all sources) of the static environment. Compensating for registration errors of static objects and modeling aircraft movement reduces registration errors for dynamic (aircraft) objects to ≤2° of error for aircraft-surveillance transport latency ≤ 5 seconds, and to ≤1° of error for transport latency ≤ 2 seconds.},

abstract = {The Stroop Test is a well known and regularly employed stressor in laboratory research. In contrast to other methods, it is not based on fear of physical harm or social shame. Consequently, it is more likely accepted by a wide population. In our always-on, technology-driven, social-media centered world, large-scale in-field stress research will need adequate experimental tools to explore the increasing prevalence of stress-related diseases without bringing subjects into laboratories. This is why we designed the Stroop Room: A virtual reality-based adaptation of the Stroop Test using elements of the virtual world to extend the demands of the original test and at the same time make it easily accessible. It is open source and can be used and improved by anyone as an in-the-wild, repeatable, laboratory-quality stressor. In this work, the method is presented and an evaluation study described, to demonstrate its effectiveness in provoking cognitive stress. 16 male and 16 female subjects were tested in the Stroop Room while recording the electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, saliva based cortisol and alpha-amylase, performance metrics and an array of questionnaire-based assessments regarding psychological confounders, stress state and likability of the simulation. Our results show that the Stroop Room increases heart rate on average by 19\%, other heart rate variability time-domain parameters (RMSSD, pNN50) decrease by 24\%-47\%, and its most stress-correlated frequency-parameter (LF/HF) increases by 107\%. Skin conductance (SC) level increases by 63\% and non-specific SC responses by 135\% on average. Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase concentrations increase significantly in some specific conditions. Compared to related work using the Stroop Test, this is an improvement for some metrics by around 30\%-40\%. Questionnaire evaluation show a strong engagement of users with the simulation and some aspects of a flow-induction. These findings support the effectiveness of a Stroop Test involving 3-dimensional interactivity and thus the Stroop Room demonstrates how this can be applied in a playful interaction that could be used pervasively.},

abstract = {Mental rotation, a common measure of spatial ability, has traditionally been assessed through paper-based instruments like the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) or the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Rotations (PSVT:R). The fact that these instruments present 3D shapes in a 2D format devoid of natural cues like shading and perspective likely limits their ability to accurately assess the fundamental skill of mentally rotating 3D shapes. In this paper, we describe the Virtual Reality Mental Rotation Assessment (VRMRA), a virtual reality-based mental rotation assessment derived from the Revised PSVT:R and MRT. The VRMRA reimagines traditional mental rotation assessments in a room-scale virtual environment and uses hand-tracking and elements of gamification in attempts to create an intuitive, engaging experience for test-takers. To validate the instrument, we compared response patterns in the VRMRA with patterns observed on the MRT and Revised PSVT:R. For the PSVT:R-type questions, items requiring a rotation around two axes were significantly harder than items requiring rotations around a single axis in the VRMRA, which is not the case in the Revised PSVT:R. For the MRT-type questions in the VRMRA, a moderate negative correlation was found between the degree of rotation in the X direction and item difficulty. While the problem of occlusion was reduced, features of the shapes and distractors accounted for 50.6\% of the variance in item difficulty. Results suggest that the VRMRA is likely a more accurate tool to assess mental rotation ability in comparison to traditional instruments which present the stimuli through 2D media. Our findings also point to potential problems with the fundamental designs of the Revised PSVT:R and MRT question formats.},

Instead of in field experiments, such systems could be tested in safe and more controlled simulated environments; however, their validity needs verification. We evaluated the validity of mixed reality (MR) simulation for bicycle support systems notifying of dooring hazards. In a mixed-design study (N=43) with environment type(MR/test track) as within and hazard notifications (with/without) as between factor, comparing subjective and objective measures across environments. In conclusion, MR simulation is absolutely valid for user experience and perceived safety and relatively valid for workload, standard deviation of lateral position, and speed. However, MR simulation was not valid for lateral distance, as participants cycled more in the center of the street than on the test track, perhaps to avoid simulator sickness. Thus, we conclude that MR simulation is valuable for studying bicycle safety.},

abstract = {The primary objective of this study is to verify the effectiveness of virtual reality forest meditation as an intervention for test anxiety among college students and to investigate the impact of three factors: namely forest style, meditation state, and pranayama guidance, on the intervention effect. A total of thirty participants exhibiting moderate or higher levels of test anxiety were subjected to an induction of test anxiety followed by a virtual reality forest meditation intervention comprising various combinations of the aforementioned three factors. Participants' levels of test anxiety were measured by the TAS scores and the quantification of brainwave energy. The results of the paired sample T-test demonstrate that virtual reality forest meditation constitutes an efficacious intervention for test anxiety among college students. The results of a three-factor analysis of variance revealed that both meditation state and pranayama guidance significantly influenced the effectiveness of virtual reality forest meditation intervention, while forest style did not demonstrate a significant impact. Specifically, wandering meditation was found to be more effective than sitting meditation, and interventions with pranayama guidance were more successful than those without pranayama guidance. Therefore, it can be concluded that guided wandering meditation combined with pranayama in a virtual reality forest environment offers superior alleviation of test anxiety among college students.},

abstract = {Distributed simulation is desirable at many levels of system design. Modeling and simulation of large complex systems, remote monitoring and control, and nondestructive remote testing of devices are three examples of the many applications in which both distributed and realtime distributed simulation are advantageous. Distributed simulation reduces simulation complexity by allowing the partitioning of a large complex system into two or more smaller subsystems. In addition, distributed simulation permits computational resource sharing and enables teamwork. The Virtual Test Bed (VTB) and its real-time extension, VTB-RT, have been adapted to deal with distributed simulation in both non-real-time and real-time. Efforts at Mississippi State University and the University of South Carolina have made possible the addition of models for distributed simulation to the VTB model library to handle both natural and signal coupling at the decoupling point. The focus of these efforts has been on the algorithms used to enforce simulation stability and energy conservation in a distributed environment. Implementation issues related to the different communication architectures used in distributed simulation environments are only briefly discussed in this paper. The models for distributed simulation described in this paper are implemented using a simple remote procedure call communication scheme, which is sufficient to demonstrate the proposed algorithms. Several examples presented in this paper demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the developed VTB models.},

abstract = {Metamorphic Testing (MT) alleviates the oracle problem by defining oracles based on metamorphic relations (MRs), that govern multiple related inputs and their outputs. However, designing MRs is challenging, as it requires domain-specific knowledge. This hinders the widespread adoption of MT. We observe that developer-written test cases can embed domain knowledge that encodes MRs. Such encoded MRs could be synthesized for testing not only their original programs but also other programs that share similar functionalities. In this paper, we propose MR-Scout to automatically synthesize MRs from test cases in open-source software (OSS) projects. MR-Scout first discovers MR-encoded test cases (MTCs), and then synthesizes the encoded MRs into parameterized methods (called codified MRs), and filters out MRs that demonstrate poor quality for new test case generation. MR-Scout discovered over 11,000 MTCs from 701 OSS projects. Experimental results show that over 97\% of codified MRs are of high quality for automated test case generation, demonstrating the practical applicability of MR-Scout. Furthermore, codified-MRs-based tests effectively enhance the test adequacy of programs with developer-written tests, leading to 13.52\% and 9.42\% increases in line coverage and mutation score, respectively. Our qualitative study shows that 55.76\% to 76.92\% of codified MRs are easily comprehensible for developers.},

abstract = {Systems in many safety-critical application domains are subject to certification requirements. In such a system, there are typically different applications providing functionalities that have varying degrees of criticality. Consequently, the certification requirements for functionalities at these different criticality levels are also varying, with very high levels of assurance required for a highly critical functionality, whereas relatively low levels of assurance are required for a less critical functionality. Considering the timing assurance given to various applications in the form of guaranteed budgets within deadlines, a theory of real-time scheduling for such multi-criticality systems has been recently under development. In particular, an algorithm called Earliest Deadline First with Virtual Deadlines (EDF-VD) has shown a lot of promise for systems with two criticality levels, especially in terms of practical performance demonstrated through experiment results. In this article, we design a new schedulability test for EDF-VD that extends these performance benefits to multi-criticality systems. We propose a new test based on demand bound functions and also present a novel virtual deadline assignment strategy. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms existing strategies for a variety of generic real-time systems.},

abstract = {English - With 'ICAORSmulti' we present a cooperative Virtual Reality application that was developed for the presentation and validation of multimodal interaction techniques. To have an application scenario at our disposal that is attractive and can be demonstrated at trade shows, we chose a flying-based virtual environment for multiple users. The latter are able to interact and assume different roles. As input devices, we use up to two ICAROS flying machines that were specially designed to simulate a flight in VR. The users can move and navigate through the VR environment in a horizontal position (see figure 1). By means of a head-mounted display (HMD) they can see their virtual surroundings, while the sensor technology attached to the Icaros detects and communicates their movements. Actuator devices such as wind machines, heat lamps and others enable a multimodal output and improve the immersion of the flight simulation. Beyond that, it is also possible to integrate other devices and 3D interaction techniques such as running, climbing etc. into the current scene. All users are able to see each other and to communicate. For the simple development and testing of 3D interaction techniques based on predefined templates in Unity3D, several different components have already been developed and integrated. They are briefly described in this paper and can be tried out in a demonstration at the conference 'Mensch und Computer 2019'. One of the unique features of this project are components that perceive a measurable decline in immersion, e.g. a limitation of the viewing area, the latency or the frame rate.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) makes use of psychological stressors to enable users to feel immersed in different domains. Although stressor tests, like the Color-Word Stroop Test (CWST), have been shown to be valid and reliable, there are limited deployments of such stressors that exhibit appropriate immersion and user experience in VR. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of two VR simulators of the CWST. We conducted a between-subjects study with 27 participants who completed the conventional CWST, a VR-only simulator of the CWST, and a gamified VR simulator of the CWST. We measured and conducted a statistical analysis of participants’ CWST scores, perceived stress, immersion, user experience, playability, and heart rate. Our results show that there are no significant differences in using the two CWST simulators of the VR. We found that users’ heart rate is significantly higher when using the VR simulators than the conventional CWST and that the VR game simulator significantly shows a higher score in immersion than the VR-only simulator. However, users’ perceived stress was significantly less when using the VR game simulator. Finally, we reflect on design insights for stressors tests in VR and discuss directions for future work.},

abstract = {Dependability is a vital system requirement, particularly in safety critical and mission critical real-time systems, due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of failures. In most critical applications different fault tolerance mechanisms using redundancy are employed to prevent possible failures. In the case of real-time systems the system designer must ensure that the task set is feasible even under faults, which we refer to as 'fault tolerance feasibility'. Due to cost considerations, often temporal redundancy has been prevalently used to meet this objective.In this paper we focus on guaranteeing fault-tolerance feasibility under error bursts on uni-processor systems by the usage of resource augmentation, specifically through processor speed-up. Firstly, we derive a processor demand bound based sufficient condition for a set of real-time tasks to be fault tolerance feasible under an assumption that no more than one error burst occurs during the hyper-period of the task set. Subsequently, we derive the necessary resource augmentation bounds (i.e., the processor speed-up), that guarantees the fault tolerance feasibility, if the sufficient test fails. Finally, we prove that, if the error burst length is no more than half the shortest relative deadline of the task set, the minimum processor speed-up required to guarantee fault tolerance feasibility is upper-bounded by 6.},

abstract = {Real-time control systems (RTCSs) perform complex control and require low response times. They typically use third-party software libraries and are deployed on generic hardware, which suffer from delay faults that can cause serious damage. To improve availability and latency, the controllers in RTCSs are replicated on physical nodes. As physical replication is expensive, we study the alternative of exploiting virtualization technology to run multiple virtual replicas on the same physical node. As virtual replicas share the same resources, the delay faults they experience might be correlated, which would make such a replication method unsuitable. We conduct several experiments with an RTCS for electric grids, with multiple virtual replicas of its controller. We find that although the delay of a virtual machine is higher than of a physical machine, the correlation between high delays among the virtual replicas is insignificant, causing an overall improved availability. We conclude that virtual replication is indeed applicable to certain RTCSs, as it can improve reliability without added cost.},

abstract = {Construction sites are still considered to be one of the most dangerous working environments for human beings. In 2017, approximately one third of all fatal accidents at a workplace in Germany occurred in the construction industry. To a certain extent, this is because double tasks are performed continuously in this rather dynamic working environment: On the one hand, construction workers have to carry out their work tasks and on the other hand, they have to take into account their own safety. This paper presents a concept for a test environment based on virtual reality, which should make it possible to realistically design several hazard scenarios and examine to what extent the chosen type of vibration-based warnings helps to avoid danger in hazardous situations. Finally, different challenges for such a test environment will be discussed.},

abstract = {Mime is a tablet-based augmented reality system which guides new chemotherapy patients through testing their blood at home. Starting from the socio-economic push towards home healthcare, we use blood analysis as a case study to illustrate the user experience challenges of unassisted care at home and how AR may support the user. We then show our explorations during an early ideation workshop, using low-fi prototyping and acting out. We also show steps from our making process in which we combine various tools, both physical and virtual, to further our understanding. We conclude with our final demonstrator and the discussions it triggered.},

abstract = {Virtual reality has reached the consumer market and exhibited the potential to become a large social and commercial platform for mainstream markets. New, low-cost devices for virtual reality or mixed reality such as the Oculus Rift, Sony's Project Morpheus, or Microsoft's HoloLens are already available or have been announced and might even outperform previous high-cost systems [Young et al. 2014]. Techniques to measure hand motions are in the making with the goal of being able to control virtual hands using one's own hand movements as well as interact with objects in virtual reality applications. Prototypes such as the combination of the Leap Motion Controller and the Oculus Rift are already available. Applications for these devices will certainly follow.},
